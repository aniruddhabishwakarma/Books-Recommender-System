Kamat",Computers,2022-09-01,CRC Press,,,187,"Over the period of last few decades, the ‘C’ language has become an icon for computer programmers. The field of computer science has undergone tremendous change, and the rate of obsolescence of concepts, programming platforms, tools and utilities is extremely high. However, in spite of such vast changes, the only thing that has retained its stability is the ‘C’ language. Even today, millions of students, hobbyists and professional programmers enjoy the sturdiness, reliability and user friendliness of the ‘C’ language. Today ‘C’ enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been “learning-through-doing”, which is one that often appeals to programmers. Theory is followed by practical implementation, and in this way the book will cover programming aspects in a self-tutor manner providing an excellent overview, from basic to advance programming. Topics discussed include: • GCC interface• First time ‘C’ User• Decision and looping structures• Arrays and pointers• Functions, structures and union• Linear data structures",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ofyGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ofyGEAAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ofyGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api
YXQsDwAAQBAJ,Coding Literacy,Annette Vee,Computers,2017-07-28,MIT Press,,,375,"How the theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming in its historical, social and conceptual contexts. The message from educators, the tech community, and even politicians is clear: everyone should learn to code. To emphasize the universality and importance of computer programming, promoters of coding for everyone often invoke the concept of “literacy,” drawing parallels between reading and writing code and reading and writing text. In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame. The theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming beyond a technical level, and in its historical, social, and conceptual contexts. Viewing programming from the perspective of literacy and literacy from the perspective of programming, she argues, shifts our understandings of both. Computer programming becomes part of an array of communication skills important in everyday life, and literacy, augmented by programming, becomes more capacious. Vee examines the ways that programming is linked with literacy in coding literacy campaigns, considering the ideologies that accompany this coupling, and she looks at how both writing and programming encode and distribute information. She explores historical parallels between writing and programming, using the evolution of mass textual literacy to shed light on the trajectory of code from military and government infrastructure to large-scale businesses to personal use. Writing and coding were institutionalized, domesticated, and then established as a basis for literacy. Just as societies demonstrated a “literate mentality” regardless of the literate status of individuals, Vee argues, a “computational mentality” is now emerging even though coding is still a specialized skill.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api

_SigDQAAQBAJ,Erlang and Elixir for Imperative Programmers,Wolfgang Loder,Computers,2016-11-26,Apress,,,260,"Learn and understand Erlang and Elixir and develop a working knowledge of the concepts of functional programming that underpin them. This book takes the author’s experience of taking on a project that required functional programming and real-time systems, breaks it down, and organizes it. You will get the necessary knowledge about differences to the languages you know, where to start, and where to go next. Have you been told by your customer or manager that they heard good things about Erlang, you should use it for the next project? Never had to deal with functional programming or real-time systems? In 2014, the author, Wolfgang Loder, developed a repository for digital assets that had to deliver those assets in binary form quickly and reliably, being able to deal with at least hundreds of requests per second. Since he could decide the architecture and software stack of the solution, he immediately thought of Erlang and its libraries and started to evaluate this option. It was not long after that he discovered Elixir, which sits on top of the Erlang virtual machine and has features more palatable for non-functional programmers, although it is a functional programming language itself. Erlang and Elixir for Imperative Programmers gives you a basis for deciding whether the effort is viable for your next project. This book is partly a tale of the author's own experience and partly a description of the bigger and more subtle differences between Erlang/Elixir and languages such as C++, Java, and C#. What You'll Learn Discover functional programming, Erlang, and Elixir Work on service design and service features Set up your environment: deployment, development, and production Implement the service including public interface, asset processing, and deployment Use the patterns and concepts found in Erlang including type creation concepts and code structuring.

HkfxBQAAQBAJ,Self-Healing Composites,Guoqiang Li,Technology & Engineering,2014-11-17,John Wiley & Sons,,,386,"In this book, the self-healing of composite structures with shape memory polymer as either matrix or embedded suture is systematically discussed. Self-healing has been well known in biological systems for many years: a typical example is the self-healing of human skin. Whilst a minor wound can be self-closed by blood clotting, a deep and wide cut needs external help by suturing. Inspired by this observation, this book proposes a two-step close-then-heal (CTH) scheme for healing wide-opened cracks in composite structures–by constrained shape recovery first, followed by molecular healing. It is demonstrated that the CTH scheme can heal wide-opened structural cracks repeatedly, efficiently, timely, and molecularly. It is believed that self-healing represents the next-generation technology and will become an engineering reality in the near future. The book consists of both fundamental background and practical skills for implementing the CTH scheme, with additional focus on understanding strain memory versus stress memory and healing efficiency evaluation under various fracture modes. Potential applications to civil engineering structures, including sealant for bridge decks and concrete pavements, and rutting resistant asphalt pavements, are also explored. This book will help readers to understand this emerging field, and to establish a framework for new innovation in this direction. Key features: explores potential applications of shape memory polymers in civil engineering structures, which is believed to be unique within the literature balanced testing and mathematical modeling, useful for both academic researchers and practitioners the self-healing scheme is based on physical change of polymers and is written in an easy to understand style for engineering professionals without a strong background in chemistry",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HkfxBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HkfxBQAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HkfxBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&dq=programming&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api

Presenting the distinguished and exemplary works by educators and researchers in the field highlighting the contemporary trends and issues, creative and unique approaches, innovative methods, frameworks, pedagogies and theoretical and practical aspects in computational thinking. A decade ago the notion of computational thinking was introduced by Jeannette Wing and envisioned that computational thinking will be a fundamental skill that complements to reading, writing and arithmetic for everyone and represents a universally applicable attitude. The computational thinking is considered a thought processes involved in a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour. Assimilating computational thinking at young age will assist them to enhance problem solving skills, improve logical reasoning, and advance analytical ability - key attributes to succeed in the 21st century. Educators around the world are investing their relentless effort in equipping the young generation with real-world skills ready for the demand and challenges of the future.

Though many Prolog textbooks have been published since, this one has withstood the test of time because of its comprehensiveness, tutorial approach, and emphasis on general programming applications. Prolog has continued to attract a great deal of interest in the computer science community, and has turned out to be the basis for an important new generation of programming languages and systems for Artificial Intelligence. Since the previous edition of Programming in Prolog, the language has been standardised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and this book has been updated accordingly. The authors have also introduced some new material, clarified some explanations, corrected a number of minor errors, and removed appendices about Prolog systems that are now obsolete.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VjHk2Cjrti8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VjHk2Cjrti8C&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VjHk2Cjrti8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api

ZBg1AAAAIAAJ,Computer Programming,"Marvin L. Stein, William D. Munro",Computer programming,1964,,,,516,"Computer Programming: A Mixed Language Approach describes computer programming from a mixed language perspective. More specifically, it examines how to make effective use of the hardware and software aspects of the total system using the mixed languages that are a composite of the absolute machine languages and the more facile problem-oriented languages. In addition to the absolute machine language required by the computer ""hardware"" and the problem-oriented language provided by the ""software"" of symbolic assembly programs and compilers, a third kind of programming language is considered, namely, the symbolic machine language. Comprised of nine chapters, this book illustrates mixed language programming using Fortran and the Fortran Symbolic Assembly Program. The discussion begins by describing a modern digital computer and introducing the general theory of number systems. Subsequent chapters focus on the way in which computing machines are organized to perform their functions; how a computer executes the sequence of instructions and performs a given calculation, a process known as coding; and non-arithmetic instructions used on computers. Subroutines, input-output, and assembly of complete programs are also explored. The final chapter is devoted to Fortran and programs written completely in Fortran, as well as executive programs and programs in mixed languages.

Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author's many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.",,http://books.google.com/books?id=iVhezwEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iVhezwEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api

It is only during the early to mid eighties that books, conferences and journals devoted entirely to Logic Programming began to appear. Consequently, much of the work done during this first crucial decade in Marseilles, Edinburgh, London, Budapest and Stockholm (to name a few) is often overlooked or difficult to trace. There are now two main regular conferences on Logic Programming, and at least five journals: The Journal of Logic Programming, New Generation Computing, Automated Reasoning, The Journal of SJmbolic Computation, and Future Generation Computer Systems. Logic Programming, however, has its roots in Automated Theorem Proving and via the expanding area of expert systems, strongly influences researchers in such varied fields as Civil Engineering, Chemistry, Law, etc. Consequently, many papers related to Logic Programming appear in a wide variety of journals and proceedings of conferences in other disciplines. This is particularly true of Computer Science where a revolution is taking place in hardware design, programming languages, and more recently databases.

When the end of this process could be foreseen and the International Standard ""Graphical Kernel System"" (GKS) was cast into its. final form, the urgent need arose for detailed information to the graphics community about this stan dard and for the education of graphics programmers. One major goal of GKS, besides the portability of graphical application programs and the device inde pendence, is ""programmer portability"" by establishing a common base for train ing of graphics programmers. Having accompanied the path of GKS from the very early stages of defining the basic concepts and designing its first versions up to the final draft of the International Standard, we feIt it worthwhile to start the venture of a text book on computer graphics programming based on GKS. This book is aimed, at one hand, at graphics users, experts and managers who want to get an overview of the new standard and a better understanding of its concepts. On the other hand, it addresses the graphics programmers who want to use GKS for realizing their graphical applications. It can serve as the base for teaching and studying functions, concepts and methods of GKS.

a_kdwtoIAx4C,Your Wish is My Command,Henry Lieberman,Computers,2001-03-12,Elsevier,,,443,"As user interface designers, software developers, and yes-as users, we all know the frustration that comes with using ""one size fits all"" software from off the shelf. Repeating the same commands over and over again, putting up with an unfriendly graphical interface, being unable to program a new application that you thought of yourself-these are all common complaints. The inflexibility of today's computer interfaces makes many people feel like they are slaves to their computers. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Why can't technology give us more ""custom-fitting"" software? On the horizon is a new technology that promises to give ordinary users the power to create and modify their own programs. Programming by example (PBE) is a technique in which a software agent records a user's behavior in an interactive graphical interface, then automatically writes a program that will perform that behavior for the user. Your Wish is My Command: Programming by Example takes a broad look at this new technology. In these nineteen chapters, programming experts describe implemented systems showing that PBE can work in a wide variety of application fields. They include the following: The renowned authors and their editor believe that PBE will some day make it possible for interfaces to effectively say to the user, ""Your wish is my command!"" - Text and graphical editing - Web browsing - Computer-aided design - Teaching programming to children - Programming computer games - Geographical information systems",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a_kdwtoIAx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=a_kdwtoIAx4C&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=a_kdwtoIAx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api

c8fyzQEACAAJ,Computer Programming,"Zack Fleming, Steven Webber",Uncategorized,2019-02-16,,,,94,"Description Inside, you will find an introduction to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. These are computer programming languages. Some of them are more precisely referred to as scripting languages. Starting with JavaScript, I will introduce you to the above-mentioned programming languages. Hopefully, by the end of this book, you will have the answers to the questions of what it is and what you can do with it. JavaScript is a programming language that allows for the implementation of complex items on static web pages. Every time you look at a web page that does something besides display static information, it is a pretty safe assumption to make that JavaScript is involved. It is often referred to as the third layer of the cake. HTML is a relatively simple programming language that, at its core, consists of elements. These elements allow you to distinguish different sections of text as different aspects on your page. Whether it be a paragraph, a heading, a column, or whatever you need it to be--this is accomplished with the use of these elements. This language is also where you get the ability to create hyperlinks. The use of hyperlinks is very important, especially when you want to be able to direct someone to a specific part of your text or page. CSS is a programming language that is used to style and structure the layout of a web page. If you want to change your font, color, and background, you may do so by adding an animation or design a specific outline. This is the language you're going to make use of to accomplish those things. CSS makes use of the box model--most elements are represented as a box with the content, padding, and borders built-up like layers on an onion. You need to understand the box model before you can begin to understand how to create CSS layouts. Meanwhile, SQL is a programming language that is designed to work with sets of facts and how they relate to each other. As you might expect, relational database programs make use of SQL. Like many other computer languages, SQL is, in fact, an international standard. However, SQL is easily read and understood even by beginners. Data sets are described in SQL using SELECT statements. An SQL statement is like a sentence and consists of clauses. Some clauses are required in a SELECT statement.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c8fyzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=c8fyzQEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=c8fyzQEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api

Introduction to the Theory of Programming Languages gives the reader the means to discover the tools to think, design, and implement these languages. It proposes a unified vision of the different formalisms that permit definition of a programming language: small steps operational semantics, big steps operational semantics, and denotational semantics, emphasising that all seek to define a relation between three objects: a program, an input value, and an output value. These formalisms are illustrated by presenting the semantics of some typical features of programming languages: functions, recursivity, assignments, records, objects, ... showing that the study of programming languages does not consist of studying languages one after another, but is organized around the features that are present in these various languages. The study of these features leads to the development of evaluators, interpreters and compilers, and also type inference algorithms, for small languages.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YZ__sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YZ__sgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YZ__sgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api

Wiener noted the paradox when the modem computer was hardly more than a laboratory curiosity. Thirty years later, the same paradox is at the heart of a severe identity crisis which con fronts computer programmers. Are they primarily members of ""management"" acting as foremen, whose task it is to ensure that orders emanating from executive suites are faithfully trans lated into comprehensible messages? Or are they perhaps sim ply engineers preoccupied with the technical difficulties of relating ""software"" to ""hardware"" and vice versa? Are they aware, furthermore, of the degree to which their work whether as manager or engineer-routinizes the work of others and thereby helps shape the structure of social class relation ships? I doubt that many of us who lived through the first heady and frantic years of software development-at places like the RAND and System Development Corporations-ever took time to think about such questions.

f3j_sgEACAAJ,Programming in D,Ali Cehreli,Uncategorized,2015-08-19,CreateSpace,,,798,"The main aim of this book is to teach D to readers who are new to computer programming. Although having experience in other programming languages is certainly helpful, this book starts from the basics. D is a multi-paradigm system programming language that combines a wide range of powerful programming concepts from the lowest to the highest levels. It has C-like syntax and static typing. It pragmatically combines efficiency, control, and modeling power, with safety and programmer productivity in mind. Each chapter is based on the contents of the previous ones, introducing as few new concepts as possible. It is recommended that the book is read in linear fashion, without skipping chapters if possible. Although this book was written with beginners in mind, it covers almost all features of D. More experienced programmers can use the book as a D language reference by starting from the index section. Blurbs from the back cover: ""D is pristine, clean, immensely powerful, and arguably the actual state-of-the-art programming language. Ali's book is a gem. Clear, concise, and complete."" - Olivier Henley ""I have been using Ali's online D book to teach D at the university level. It is up-to-date, complete, and most importantly, extremely readable. Having a print version is even better! This is now the 'go-to' book for learning D programming."" - Chuck Allison, Professor and Chair, Computer Science Department, Utah Valley University ""Ali's explanations are succinct and on target. I like that he provides rationale for why D was designed in a particular way and how I can use it most effectively. This is the best computer language book I've read."" - Robbin Carlson, Luthier and Enterprise Architect ""I taught a CS2 Data Structures class in D with more success and student appreciation than when using either C++ or Java as it's an ideal language to express the relevant concepts at all scales, from detailed to big picture, without needless complexity. Ali Çehreli's tutorial played a central role supporting students especially during the first half of the course - without it the course simply would not have worked, so ""many thanks Ali"" - and an important part of that is its linearity - it can be read with only backward dependencies. This meant that with hard work even students of little experience and only moderate current abilities could get up to speed, and we saw just that. It is hard to overstate this factor. I unreservedly recommend this book to all."" - Dr. Carl Sturtivant, University of Minnesota Department of Computer Science & Engineering ""This book is one of the best guides through the language that I've seen."" - Andrew Wray, D Enthusiast ""I encourage anyone considering D to read this book. Not exactly 'D for Dummies' but it's easy to follow even if you don't have much experience with compiled languages."" - bachmeier, Reddit user ""Having worked through the book, I have to say this is one of the easiest to follow and distraction free read there is and the fact that it made learning a new language a total breeze really impressed me."" - Imran Khan, Student",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f3j_sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=f3j_sgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=f3j_sgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api

Anton Spraul,Computers,2020-08-11,No Starch Press,,,0,"Programming isn’t just about syntax and assembling code—it’s about problem solving, and all good programmers must think creatively to solve problems. Like the best-selling Think Like a Programmer before it (with over 75,000 copies sold worldwide), this Python-based edition will help you transition from reading programs to writing them, in, Python. (No prior programming experience required!) Rather than simply point out solutions to problems, author V. Anton Spraul will get you thinking by exposing you to techniques that will teach you how to solve programming problems on your own. Each chapter covers a single programming concept like data types, control flow, code reuse, recursion, and classes, then a series of Python-based exercises have you put your skills to the test. You’ll learn how to: -Break big problems down into simple, manageable steps to build into solutions -Write custom functions to solve new problems -Use a debugger to examine each line of your running program in order to fully understand how it works -Tackle problems strategically by turning each new concept into a problem-solving tool The Python edition of Think Like a Programmer aims squarely at the beginning programmer, with additional chapters on early programming topics such as variables, decisions, and looping.

LDiizgEACAAJ,Build Your Own Programming Language,Clinton L. Jeffery,Programming languages (Electronic computers),2021-12-31,,,,494,"Written by the creator of the Unicon programming language, this book will show you how to implement programming languages to reduce the time and cost of creating applications for new or specialized areas of computing Key Features: Reduce development time and solve pain points in your application domain by building a custom programming language Learn how to create parsers, code generators, file readers, analyzers, and interpreters Create an alternative to frameworks and libraries to solve domain-specific problems Book Description: The need for different types of computer languages is growing rapidly and developers prefer creating domain-specific languages for solving specific application domain problems. Building your own programming language has its advantages. It can be your antidote to the ever-increasing size and complexity of software. However, creating a custom language isn't easy. In this book, you'll be able to put the knowledge you gain to work in language design and implementation. You'll implement the frontend of a compiler for your language, including a lexical analyzer and parser. The book covers a series of traversals of syntax trees, culminating with code generation for a bytecode virtual machine. Moving ahead, you'll learn how domain-specific language (DSL) features are often best represented by operators and functions that are built into the language, rather than library functions. The book concludes by showing you how to implement garbage collection, including reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage collection. Throughout the book, Dr. Jeffery weaves in his experience of building the Unicon programming language to give better context to the concepts, while providing relevant examples in Unicon and Java. By the end of this book, you'll be able to build and deploy your own domain-specific languages, capable of compiling and running programs. What You Will Learn: Perform requirements analysis for the new language and design language syntax and semantics Write lexical and context-free grammar rules for common expressions and control structures Develop a scanner that reads source code and generate a parser that checks syntax Build key data structures in a compiler and use your compiler to build a syntax-coloring code editor Implement a bytecode interpreter and run bytecode generated by your compiler Write tree traversals that insert information into the syntax tree Implement garbage collection in your language Who this book is for: This book is for software developers interested in the idea of inventing their own language or developing a domain-specific language. Computer science students taking compiler construction courses will also find this book highly useful as a practical guide to language implementation to supplement more theoretical textbooks. Intermediate-level knowledge and experience working with a high-level language such as Java or the C++ language are expected to help you get the most out of this book.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LDiizgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LDiizgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LDiizgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api

To my knowledge, this is the first book on modern programming languages and programming meth odology devoted entirely to database application environments. At the same time, it is written with the goal of reconciling the relational and object-oriented approaches to database management. One of the reasons that influenced my decision to write this book is my dissatisfaction with the fact that the existing books on programming methodology and the associated concepts, techniques, and programming language notation are largely based on mathematical problems and math ematically oriented algorithms. As such, they give the impression that modern program structures, associated techniques, and methodologies, not to speak of the formal ones, are applicable only to problems of that sort. Although important, such problems are of limited applicability and scale. This does not apply to books in which modem concepts, techniques, methodologies, and programming language notation are applied to systems programming. But, even so, this does not demonstrate that in entirely application-oriented problems-those in which modern computer tech nology is most widely used-modern programming methodology is just as important.

9yw3AgAAQBAJ,Design Concepts in Programming Languages,"Franklyn Turbak, David Gifford",Computers,2008-07-18,MIT Press,,,1347,"Key ideas in programming language design and implementation explained using a simple and concise framework; a comprehensive introduction suitable for use as a textbook or a reference for researchers. Hundreds of programming languages are in use today—scripting languages for Internet commerce, user interface programming tools, spreadsheet macros, page format specification languages, and many others. Designing a programming language is a metaprogramming activity that bears certain similarities to programming in a regular language, with clarity and simplicity even more important than in ordinary programming. This comprehensive text uses a simple and concise framework to teach key ideas in programming language design and implementation. The book's unique approach is based on a family of syntactically simple pedagogical languages that allow students to explore programming language concepts systematically. It takes as premise and starting point the idea that when language behaviors become incredibly complex, the description of the behaviors must be incredibly simple. The book presents a set of tools (a mathematical metalanguage, abstract syntax, operational and denotational semantics) and uses it to explore a comprehensive set of programming language design dimensions, including dynamic semantics (naming, state, control, data), static semantics (types, type reconstruction, polymporphism, effects), and pragmatics (compilation, garbage collection). The many examples and exercises offer students opportunities to apply the foundational ideas explained in the text. Specialized topics and code that implements many of the algorithms and compilation methods in the book can be found on the book's Web site, along with such additional material as a section on concurrency and proofs of the theorems in the text. The book is suitable as a text for an introductory graduate or advanced undergraduate programming languages course; it can also serve as a reference for researchers and practitioners.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9yw3AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9yw3AgAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9yw3AgAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=135&source=gbs_api

ZvFSAAAAMAAJ,Network Troubleshooting Tools,Joseph D Sloan,Computers,2001,"O'Reilly Media, Inc.",,,376,"Over the years, thousands of tools have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks. They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them? Network Troubleshooting Tools does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of ping that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's tkined for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems. This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively. The topics covered in this book include: Understanding your network Connectivity testing Evaluating the path between two network nodes Tools for capturing packets Tools for network discovery and mapping Tools for working with SNMP Performance monitoring Testing application layer protocols Software sources If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZvFSAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvFSAAAAMAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvFSAAAAMAAJ&q=programming&dq=programming&hl=&cd=140&source=gbs_api

lrgrDwAAQBAJ,The Rust Programming Language,"Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols",Computers,2018-07-10,No Starch Press,5,1,553,"The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust, an open-source, community-developed systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This is the undisputed go-to guide to Rust, written by two members of the Rust core team, with feedback and contributions from 42 members of the community. The book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but makes no assumptions about which one, meaning the material is accessible and useful to developers from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. Known by the Rust community as “The Book,” The Rust Programming Language includes concept chapters, where you’ll learn about a particular aspect of Rust, and project chapters, where you’ll apply what you’ve learned so far to build small programs. The Book opens with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Next come detailed explanations of Rust-oriented perspectives on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers, with concrete examples and exercises--taking you from theory to practice. The Rust Programming Language will also show you how to: - Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - Use Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code, including downloading and building dependencies - Effectively use Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and employ your own You’ll learn to develop reliable code that’s speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level. When you need to dive down into lower-level control, this guide will show you how without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes and without requiring you to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain. You’ll also learn how to create command line programs, build single- and multithreaded web servers, and much more. The Rust Programming Language fully embraces Rust’s potential to empower its users. This friendly and approachable guide will help you build not only your knowledge of Rust but also your ability to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=169&source=gbs_api

Guttag,Computers,2013-08-09,MIT Press,,,315,"An introductory text that teaches students the art of computational problem solving, covering topics that range from simple algorithms to information visualization. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

You’ll learn how to: Run Python code, work with strings, and use variables Write programs that make decisions Make code more efficient with while and for loops Use Python sets, lists, and dictionaries to organize, sort, and search data Design programs using functions and top-down design Create complete-search algorithms and use Big O notation to design more efficient code By the end of the book, you’ll not only be proficient in Python, but you’ll also understand how to think through problems and tackle them with code. Programming languages come and go, but this book gives you the lasting foundation you need to start thinking like a programmer.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wo4TEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Wo4TEAAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Wo4TEAAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=195&source=gbs_api
NocyAAAAIAAJ,Object-oriented Concurrent Programming,"Akinori Yonezawa, Mario Tokoro",Computers,1987,,,,304,"This book deals with a major theme of the Japanese Fifth Generation Project, which emphasizes logic programming, parallelism, and distributed systems. It presents a collection of tutorials and research papers on a new programming and design methodology in which the system to be constructed is modeled as a collection of abstract entities called ""objects"" and concurrent messages passing among objects. This methodology is particularly powerful in exploiting as well as harnessing the parallelism that is naturally found in problem domains. The book includes several proposals for programming languages that support this methodology, as well as the applications of object-oriented concurrent programming to such diverse areas as artificial intelligence, software engineering, music synthesis, office information systems, and system programming. It is the first compilation of research results in this rapidly emerging area. Contents:Concurrent Programming Using Actors. Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming in Act-1. Modelling and Programming in a Concurrent Object-Oriented Language, ABCL/1. Concurrent Programming in ConcurrentSmallTalk. Orient84K: An Object-Oriented Concurrent Programming Language for Knowledge Representation. POOL-T: A Parallel Object-Oriented Programming Language. Concurrent Strategy Execution in Omega.

-dwPAQAAMAAJ,Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech,Cass R. Sunstein,History,1993,,,,328,"Instead, we should conceive of free speech first and foremost as a means to achieve civic deliberation and true popular sovereignty. Building on James Madison, Sunstein proposes a ""New Deal"" for the first Amendment, a new interpretation that attacks undifferentiated absolutism and replaces it with a vision of responsible public life. Sunstein examines broadcasting, campaign finance, hate speech, pornography, government art funding, commercial speech, and the privacy of rape victims. He insists that political speech, essential for the functioning of any democracy, must not only be protected, but encouraged. If the government, say were to use broadcasting markets to encourage attention to public issues and diverse points of view, the First Amendment would not stand in the way. Nonpolitical speech, on the other hand, should be less fully protected when it conflicts with other interests and rights such as that of privacy.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-dwPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-dwPAQAAMAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-dwPAQAAMAAJ&q=programming&dq=programming&hl=&cd=231&source=gbs_api

zoLztUgrKkEC,Choice of Payoff Horizon and Firm Performance,David Lawrence Souder,Cable television,2007,,,,432,"""An important managerial challenge is choosing the payoff horizon for strategic investments, since projects with long run benefits have immediate costs that reduce short run profits. My dissertation draws from the behavioral theory of the firm and agency theory to explain differences in payoff horizon choices between firms, based on performance relative to aspirations, incentive compensation, and external market pressure. I also test the intuition that long horizon investments have a positive impact on long run performance. The business model for cable operators during its programming variety phase from 1972-1996 offers a quasi-experimental setting ideally suited for research into these issues. Like public utilities, local cable companies are natural monopolies with single providers in each market. Unlike electricity, heat, or water service, however, there is neither a mandate for universal service nor municipal financing for capital investments. Furthermore, the distribution technology of microwave and, later, satellite eliminate the need for single firms to serve contiguous geographic regions, and the industry's pre-1972 history as a broadcast retransmission service contributed to a particularly disparate pattern of geographic expansion. As a result, cable operators during the research period do not compete with each other for market share among customers, but they do compete over future growth through their choice of investments. These investments have varying payoff horizons. In testing predictions about which firms pursue longer or shorter payoff horizons, I use simultaneous equation techniques. To assess the impact of short- and long-horizon investments on ex post performance, I use dynamic panel modeling that allows the direction and significance of investment choices to be interpreted at different lag lengths. What makes firms choose different payoff horizons? Are longer horizon investments associated with higher eventual performance, as conventional wisdom suggests? The first question is central to understanding firm strategy, while the second is crucial for evaluating that strategy. By addressing both, my dissertation generates corporate governance implications and insight into the value-creation potential of longer payoff horizons. In addition, it analyzes the causes and effects of the wide heterogeneity of firm strategies observed in the partially regulated and monopolistic cable industry""--Http://www.cablecenter.org/education/awards/2006GrantWinner.cfm (as viewed on 08/18/08)",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zoLztUgrKkEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=zoLztUgrKkEC&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=zoLztUgrKkEC&q=programming&dq=programming&hl=&cd=274&source=gbs_api

TWFIAAAAQBAJ,Learning C# by Programming Games,"Arjan Egges, Jeroen D. Fokker, Mark H. Overmars",Computers,2013-06-06,Springer Science & Business Media,,,449,"Developing computer games is a perfect way to learn how to program in modern programming languages. This book teaches how to program in C# through the creation of computer games – and without requiring any previous programming experience. Contrary to most programming books, Egges, Fokker and Overmars do not organize the presentation according to programming language constructs, but instead use the structure and elements of computer games as a framework. For instance, there are chapters on dealing with player input, game objects, game worlds, game states, levels, animation, physics, and intelligence. The reader will be guided through the development of four games showing the various aspects of game development. Starting with a simple shooting game, the authors move on to puzzle games consisting of multiple levels, and conclude the book by developing a full-fledged platform game with animation, game physics, and intelligent enemies. They show a number of commonly used techniques in games, such as drawing layers of sprites, rotating, scaling and animating sprites, showing a heads-up display, dealing with physics, handling interaction between game objects, and creating pleasing visual effects such as snow or glitter. At the same time, they provide a thorough introduction to C# and object-oriented programming, introducing step by step important aspects of programming in general, including many programming constructs and idioms, syntax diagrams, collections, and exception handling. The book is also designed to be used as a basis for a game-oriented programming course. For each part, there are concluding exercises and challenges, which are generally more complex programming endeavors. Lots of supplementary materials for organizing such a course are available on the accompanying web site http://www.csharpprogramminggames.com, including installation instructions, solutions to the exercises, software installation instructions, game sprites and sounds.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TWFIAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TWFIAAAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TWFIAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=288&source=gbs_api
H4q1NAEACAAJ,Multiparadigm Constraint Programming Languages,Petra Hofstedt,Computers,2011-06-17,Springer,,,180,"Programming languages are often classified according to their paradigms, e.g. imperative, functional, logic, constraint-based, object-oriented, or aspect-oriented. A paradigm characterizes the style, concepts, and methods of the language for describing situations and processes and for solving problems, and each paradigm serves best for programming in particular application areas. Real-world problems, however, are often best implemented by a combination of concepts from different paradigms, because they comprise aspects from several realms, and this combination is more comfortably realized using multiparadigm programming languages. This book deals with the theory and practice of multiparadigm constraint programming languages. The author first elaborates on programming paradigms and languages, constraints, and the merging of programming concepts which yields multiparadigm (constraint) programming languages. In the second part the author inspects two concrete approaches on multiparadigm constraint programming – the concurrent constraint functional language CCFL, which combines the functional and the constraint-based paradigms and allows the description of concurrent processes; and a general framework for multiparadigm constraint programming and its implementation, Meta-S.

The goal in this book is to slowly ease you into the different topics. It is understood that you do not always have ample free time, so the text is easy to digest and concepts are spoon fed to the reader. Starting with the simplest of topics, detailed explanations demonstrate the how and why of Ada. You are strongly encouraged to experiment and break things (without which the learning process is linear and quite dull). At the end of Beginning Ada Programming, you will have an excellent understanding of the general topics that make up the Ada programming language and can tackle far more challenging topics. Each chapter builds on what was previously described. Furthermore, each code example is independent of others and will run all by itself. Instructions are provided where you can obtain an Ada compiler and how to debug your code.

oBmYnQEACAAJ,Functional Programming Patterns in Scala and Clojure,Michael Bevilacqua-Linn,Computers,2013,O'Reilly Vlg. GmbH & Company,,,0,"Solve real-life programming problems with a fraction of the code that pure object-oriented programming requires. Use Scala and Clojure to solve in-depth problems with two sets of patterns: object-oriented patterns that become more concise with functional programming, and natively functional patterns. Your code will be more declarative, with fewer bugs and lower maintenance costs. Functional languages have their own patterns that enable you to solve problems with less code than object-oriented programming alone. This book introduces you, the experienced Java programmer, to Scala and Clojure: practical, production-quality languages that run on the JVM and interoperate with existing Java. By using both the statically typed, type-inferred Scala and the dynamically typed, modern Lisp Clojure, you'll gain a broad understanding of functional programming. For each pattern, you'll first see the traditional object-oriented solution, and then dig into the functional replacements in both Scala and Clojure. These patterns are common in the functional world and deserve to become part of your problem-solving toolkit. On the object-oriented side, you'll see many common patterns, such as Command, Strategy, and Null Object. On the functional side, you'll learn core functional patterns such as Memoization, Lazy Sequence, and Tail Recursion. Each pattern helps you solve a common programming problem. Working through them gives you a set of patterns you can use to solve problems you come across while writing programs. Finally, you'll learn how to work your existing Java code into new Scala or Clojure projects. You can start off small, adding functional code little by little, so you can complement your existing knowledge with Scala and Clojure as these languages gain popularity on the JVM. What You Need Clojure 1.5 and Scala 2.10.Optionally, Eclipse with plugins.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oBmYnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oBmYnQEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oBmYnQEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=344&source=gbs_api

oKSjBQAAQBAJ,Structured Programming Using Turbo BASIC,"Wade Ellis, Ed Lodi",Computers,2014-05-10,Academic Press,,,356,"Structured Programming Using Turbo BASIC explains programming methods using this language through mathematical or business examples and problems. The book approaches problem-solving using a top-down, structured programming method. This method consists of 1) breaking a problem into smaller, more manageable tasks, and 2) using the action block, the decision block, and the loop block—the three fundamental programming structures—to perform each task. The text describes the Turbo Basic environment on an IBM PC or compatible, the fundamental programming structures and concepts, the two data structures (arrays, files), graphics creation, as well as computer simulations. The book explains in detail variables, screen formatting, the decision block, the loop block, functions. The text also discusses parameter lists, and libraries The student learns to use the OPEN statement to associate a buffer with a file, or the CLOSE statement to end the file/buffer. The text explains the use of the Turbo BASIC random generator that produces unique sequences of random numbers. The book can be used in introductory lecture courses in business, computer science, or mathematics. It can be beneficial for students in an open-entry/open-exit computer laboratory courses or for self-study.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oKSjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oKSjBQAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oKSjBQAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=356&source=gbs_api

iNCjzgEACAAJ,A Web-based Introduction to Programming,Mike O'Kane,Computer programming,2021,,,,,"""A Web-Based Introduction to Programming combines basic HTML and CSS with PHP and MySQL to introduce essential programming syntax, operations, and control structures. The hands-on Web-based approach engages students and offers a suitable first course for a range of disciplines, including computer science, digital media, database management, technical writing, and Web development. Students use a freely available lamp distribution that can be installed in minutes and allows them to work locally on any Windows, Macintosh or Linux computer with no need to access a remote Web server. Chapters include: Introduction to Programming; Getting Started with Client/Server Applications; Basics of Markup; Basics of PHP; Working with Text Files; Selection Structures; Multiple Selection; Count-Controlled Loops; Event-Controlled Loops; Arrays; Associative Arrays and Web Sessions; Functions; MySQL (MariaDB); Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming; and Where to Go From Here. The Appendices provide additional references and topics: Data Representation; File Addressing Schemes; Working from the Command Line; Debugging Help; Security and Validation; FTP; Version Control with Git and GitHub; and PHPMyAdmin. Most appendix topics and tutorials are also available as handouts on the textbook Web site. Learning outcomes are identified at the start of each chapter, and these are tested by end-of-chapter quizzes and short, targeted code exercises designed to help beginners gain understanding and confidence: ""fixit"" exercises challenge students to identify syntax and logical errors; ""modify"" exercises require changes to existing code based on material learned in the chapter; ""complete code"" exercises build on work that was completed in previous chapters. All the textbook examples and coursework files are provided on the textbook Web site and, once copied to the standalone Web server, these provide a complete work and study environment. Note that the approach works just as well if students have access to accounts on an online Web server. This fifth edition has been significantly updated to include: revisions and improvements to most chapters; more about file navigation (Windows, OSX, and Linux); updated HTML and CSS examples (including use of the label element and CSS layout for form input); greater focus on the use of selection structures for input validation and security; two new chapters to provide more comprehensive coverage of PHP and HTML tools and elements; new options to incorporate Git and GitHub for version control, FTP for file transfer, and PHPMyAdmin for database management; new appendices and hands-on tutorials""--",,http://books.google.com/books?id=iNCjzgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iNCjzgEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=369&source=gbs_api

Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. TPJ explained critical topics such as regular expressions, databases, and object-oriented programming, and demonstrated Perl's utility for fields as diverse as astronomy, biology, economics, AI, and games. The magazine gave birth to both the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the Perl Poetry contest, and remains a proud and timeless achievement of Perl during one of its most exciting periods of development.Computer Science and Perl Programming is the first volume of The Best of the Perl Journal, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes. This volume has 70 articles devoted to hard-core computer science, advanced programming techniques, and the underlying mechanics of Perl.Here's a sample of what you'll find inside: Jeffrey Friedl on Understanding Regexes Mark Jason Dominus on optimizing your Perl programs with Memoization Damian Conway on Parsing Tim Meadowcroft on integrating Perl with Microsoft Office Larry Wall on the culture of Perl Written by 41 of the most prominent and prolific members of the closely-knit Perl community, this anthology does what no other book can, giving unique insight into the real-life applications and powerful techniques made possible by Perl.Other books tell you how to use Perl, but this book goes far beyond that: it shows you not only how to use Perl, but what you could use Perl for.

j3rPCgAAQBAJ,Programming Internet Email,David Wood,Computers,1999-08,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",,,380,"The Internet's ""killer app"" is not the World Wide Web or Push technologies: it is humble electronic mail. More people use email than any other Internet application. As the number of email users swells, and as email takes on an ever greater role in personal and business communication, Internet mail protocols have become not just an enabling technology for messaging, but a programming interface on top of which core applications are built.Programming Internet Email unmasks the Internet Mail System and shows how a loose federation of connected networks have combined to form the world's largest and most heavily trafficked message system.Programming Internet Email tames the Internet's most popular messaging service. For programmers building applications on top of email capabilities, and power users trying to get under the hood of their own email systems, Programming Internet Email stands out as an essential guide and reference book. In typical O'Reilly fashion,Programming Internet Email covers the topic with nineteen tightly written chapters and five useful appendixes.Following a thorough introduction to the Internet Mail System, the book is divided into five parts: Part I covers email formats, from basic text messages to the guts of MIME. Secure email message formats (OpenPGP and S/MIME), mailbox formats and other commonly used formats are detailed in this reference section. Part II describes Internet email protocols: SMTP and ESMTP, POP3 and IMAP4. Each protocol is covered in detail to expose the Internet Mail System's inner workings. Part III provides a solid API reference for programmers working in Perl and Java. Class references are given for commonly used Perl modules that relate to email and the Java Mail API. Part IV provides clear and concise examples of how to incorporate email capabilities into your applications. Examples are given in both Perl and Java. Part V covers the future of email on the Internet. Means and methods for controlling spam email and newly proposed Internet mail protocols are discussed. Appendixes to Programming Internet Email provide a host of explanatory information and useful references for the programmer and avid user alike, including a comprehensive list of Internet RFCs relating to email, MIME types and a list of email related URLs. Programming Internet Email will answer all of your questions about mail and extend your abilities into this most popular messaging frontier.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j3rPCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j3rPCgAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j3rPCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=440&source=gbs_api

Key Features Expand your background in GPU programming--PyCUDA, scikit-cuda, and Nsight Effectively use CUDA libraries such as cuBLAS, cuFFT, and cuSolver Apply GPU programming to modern data science applications Book Description Hands-On GPU Programming with Python and CUDA hits the ground running: you'll start by learning how to apply Amdahl's Law, use a code profiler to identify bottlenecks in your Python code, and set up an appropriate GPU programming environment. You'll then see how to ""query"" the GPU's features and copy arrays of data to and from the GPU's own memory. As you make your way through the book, you'll launch code directly onto the GPU and write full blown GPU kernels and device functions in CUDA C. You'll get to grips with profiling GPU code effectively and fully test and debug your code using Nsight IDE. Next, you'll explore some of the more well-known NVIDIA libraries, such as cuFFT and cuBLAS. With a solid background in place, you will now apply your new-found knowledge to develop your very own GPU-based deep neural network from scratch. You'll then explore advanced topics, such as warp shuffling, dynamic parallelism, and PTX assembly. In the final chapter, you'll see some topics and applications related to GPU programming that you may wish to pursue, including AI, graphics, and blockchain. By the end of this book, you will be able to apply GPU programming to problems related to data science and high-performance computing. What you will learn Launch GPU code directly from Python Write effective and efficient GPU kernels and device functions Use libraries such as cuFFT, cuBLAS, and cuSolver Debug and profile your code with Nsight and Visual Profiler Apply GPU programming to datascience problems Build a GPU-based deep neuralnetwork from scratch Explore advanced GPU hardware features, such as warp shuffling Who this book is for Hands-On GPU Programming with Python and CUDA is for developers and data scientists who want to learn the basics of effective GPU programming to improve performance using Python code.

It is an approach taken by developers to build applications and helps them add efficiency in their development process, thus making it more effective. The book starts with the fundamentals of Modular Programming. Then we move on to the actual implementation, where we teach developers how to divide an application into different modules or layers (such as presentation, execution, security, lifecycle, services, and so on) for better management. Once readers are well-versed in these modules and their development, the book shows how to create bindings in order to join these different modules and form a complete application. Next, the readers will learn how to manage these modules through dependency injection. Later, we move on to testing; readers will learn how to test the different modules of an application. The book ends by teaching readers how to maintain different versions of their application and how to modify it. By the end of the book, readers will have a good understanding of modular programming and will be able to use it to build applications with Java. Style and approach This book is a practical guide to help readers learn Modular Programming with Java and build an enterprise-ready app along the way. The book is divided into three major sections. The first teaches the fundamentals of Modular Programming and how to implement them; the second teaches readers to combine and manage the modules developed; in the final section, the book explains the applications of Modular Programming.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5f9vDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5f9vDQAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5f9vDQAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=450&source=gbs_api
jhDhzQEACAAJ,Real-Time C+,Christopher Kormanyos,Uncategorized,2015,,,,,"With this book, Christopher Kormanyos delivers a highly practical guide to programming real-time embedded microcontroller systems in C++. It is divided into three parts plus several appendices. Part I provides a foundation for real-time C++ by covering language technologies, including object-oriented methods, template programming and optimization. Next, part II presents detailed descriptions of a variety of C++ components that are widely used in microcontroller programming. It details some of C++'s most powerful language elements, such as class types, templates and the STL, to develop components for microcontroller register access, low-level drivers, custom memory management, embedded containers, multitasking, etc. Finally, part III describes mathematical methods and generic utilities that can be employed to solve recurring problems in real-time C++. The appendices include a brief C++ language tutorial, information on the real-time C++ development environment and instructions for building GNU GCC cross-compilers and a microcontroller circuit. For this second edition, the most recent specification of C++14 in ISO/IEC 14882:2014 is used throughout the text. Several sections on new C++14 functionality have been added, and various others reworked to reflect changes in the standard. Also two new sample projects are introduced, and various user suggestions have been incorporated. To facilitate portability, no libraries other than those specified in the language standard itself are used. Efficiency is always in focus and numerous examples are backed up with real-time performance measurements and size analyses that quantify the true costs of the code down to the very last byte and microsecond. The target audience of this book mainly consists of students and professionals interested in real-time C++. Readers should be familiar with C or another programming language and will benefit most if they have had some previous experience with microcontroller electronics and the performance and size issues prevalent in embedded systems programming.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jhDhzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jhDhzQEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jhDhzQEACAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&cd=451&source=gbs_api

In only a few years, many standard software products will be based on concepts of parallel programming implemented on such hardware, and the range of applications will be much broader than that of scientific computing, up to now the main application area for parallel computing. Rauber and Rünger take up these recent developments in processor architecture by giving detailed descriptions of parallel programming techniques that are necessary for developing efficient programs for multicore processors as well as for parallel cluster systems and supercomputers. Their book is structured in three main parts, covering all areas of parallel computing: the architecture of parallel systems, parallel programming models and environments, and the implementation of efficient application algorithms. The emphasis lies on parallel programming techniques needed for different architectures. The main goal of the book is to present parallel programming techniques that can be used in many situations for many application areas and which enable the reader to develop correct and efficient parallel programs. Many examples and exercises are provided to show how to apply the techniques. The book can be used as both a textbook for students and a reference book for professionals.

Programming these prolific devices is a much more involved and integrated task than it is for general-purpose microprocessors; microcontroller programmers must be fluent in application development, systems programming, and I/O operation as well as memory management and system timing. Using the popular and pervasive mid-range 8-bit Microchip PIC® as an archetype, Microcontroller Programming offers a self-contained presentation of the multidisciplinary tools needed to design and implement modern embedded systems and microcontrollers. The authors begin with basic electronics, number systems, and data concepts followed by digital logic, arithmetic, conversions, circuits, and circuit components to build a firm background in the computer science and electronics fundamentals involved in programming microcontrollers. For the remainder of the book, they focus on PIC architecture and programming tools and work systematically through programming various functions, modules, and devices. Helpful appendices supply the full mid-range PIC instruction set as well as additional programming solutions, a guide to resistor color codes, and a concise method for building custom circuit boards. Providing just the right mix of theory and practical guidance, Microcontroller Programming: The Microchip PIC® is the ideal tool for any amateur or professional designing and implementing stand-alone systems for a wide variety of applications.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VXZJEqnCGfQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VXZJEqnCGfQC&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VXZJEqnCGfQC&dq=programming&hl=&cd=480&source=gbs_api

bJhEEAAAQBAJ,Elements of Mathematics,Gabor Toth,Mathematics,2021-09-23,Springer Nature,,,534,"This textbook offers a rigorous presentation of mathematics before the advent of calculus. Fundamental concepts in algebra, geometry, and number theory are developed from the foundations of set theory along an elementary, inquiry-driven path. Thought-provoking examples and challenging problems inspired by mathematical contests motivate the theory, while frequent historical asides reveal the story of how the ideas were originally developed. Beginning with a thorough treatment of the natural numbers via Peano’s axioms, the opening chapters focus on establishing the natural, integral, rational, and real number systems. Plane geometry is introduced via Birkhoff’s axioms of metric geometry, and chapters on polynomials traverse arithmetical operations, roots, and factoring multivariate expressions. An elementary classification of conics is given, followed by an in-depth study of rational expressions. Exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions complete the picture, driven by inequalities that compare them with polynomial and rational functions. Axioms and limits underpin the treatment throughout, offering not only powerful tools, but insights into non-trivial connections between topics. Elements of Mathematics is ideal for students seeking a deep and engaging mathematical challenge based on elementary tools. Whether enhancing the early undergraduate curriculum for high achievers, or constructing a reflective senior capstone, instructors will find ample material for enquiring mathematics majors. No formal prerequisites are assumed beyond high school algebra, making the book ideal for mathematics circles and competition preparation. Readers who are more advanced in their mathematical studies will appreciate the interleaving of ideas and illuminating historical details.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bJhEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bJhEEAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bJhEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api

It offers ways of bringing together the structural domain of mathematics and the content of physics in one coherent inquiry. Teaching and learning physics is challenging because students lack the skills to merge these learning paradigms. The purpose of this book is not only to improve access to the understanding of natural phenomena but also to inspire new ways of delivering and understanding the complex concepts of physics. To sustain physics education in college classrooms, authentic training that would help develop high school students’ skills of transcending function modeling techniques to reason scientifically is needed and this book aspires to offer such training The book draws on current research in developing students’ mathematical reasoning. It identifies areas for advancements and proposes a conceptual framework that is tested in several case studies designed using that framework. Modeling Newton’s laws using limited case analysis, Modeling projectile motion using parametric equations and Enabling covariational reasoning in Einstein formula for the photoelectric effect represent some of these case studies. A wealth of conclusions that accompany these case studies, drawn from the realities of classroom teaching, is to help physics teachers and researchers adopt these ideas in practice.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=etM-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=etM-EAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=etM-EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api

Yet with so many students and big concepts to cover, it can be hard to slow down enough to look for those moments when students’ responses tell us what we need to know about next best steps. In this remarkable book, John SanGiovanni helps us value our students’ misconceptions and incomplete understandings as much as their correct ones—because it’s the gap in their understanding today that holds the secrets to planning tomorrow’s best teaching. SanGiovanni lays out 180 high-quality tasks aligned to the standards and big ideas of Grades 3-5 mathematics, including addition and subtraction of multi-digit whole numbers, multiplication and division of single and multi-digit whole numbers, foundational fraction concepts, foundational decimal concepts, and operations with fractions and decimals. The tasks are all downloadable so you can use or modify them for instruction and assessment. Each big idea offers a starting task followed by: what makes it a high-quality task what you might anticipate before students work with the task 4 student examples of the completed task showcasing a distinct ""gap"" commentary on what precisely counts for mathematical understanding and the next instructional steps commentary on the misconception or incomplete understanding so you learn why the student veered off course three additional tasks aligned to the mathematics topic and ideas about what students might do with these additional tasks. It’s time to break our habit of rushing into re-teaching for correctness and instead get curious about the space between right and wrong answers. Mine the Gap for Mathematical Understanding is a book you will return to again and again to get better at selecting tasks that will uncover students’ reasoning—better at discerning the quality and clarity of students’ understanding—and better at planning teaching based on the gaps you see.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M4EXDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M4EXDQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M4EXDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api

PgkrBgAAQBAJ,Mathematical Intuition,R.L. Tieszen,Philosophy,2012-12-06,Springer Science & Business Media,,,223,"""Intuition"" has perhaps been the least understood and the most abused term in philosophy. It is often the term used when one has no plausible explanation for the source of a given belief or opinion. According to some sceptics, it is understood only in terms of what it is not, and it is not any of the better understood means for acquiring knowledge. In mathematics the term has also unfortunately been used in this way. Thus, intuition is sometimes portrayed as if it were the Third Eye, something only mathematical ""mystics"", like Ramanujan, possess. In mathematics the notion has also been used in a host of other senses: by ""intuitive"" one might mean informal, or non-rigourous, or visual, or holistic, or incomplete, or perhaps even convincing in spite of lack of proof. My aim in this book is to sweep all of this aside, to argue that there is a perfectly coherent, philosophically respectable notion of mathematical intuition according to which intuition is a condition necessary for mathemati cal knowledge. I shall argue that mathematical intuition is not any special or mysterious kind of faculty, and that it is possible to make progress in the philosophical analysis of this notion. This kind of undertaking has a precedent in the philosophy of Kant. While I shall be mostly developing ideas about intuition due to Edmund Husser! there will be a kind of Kantian argument underlying the entire book.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PgkrBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PgkrBgAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PgkrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA199&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api

Ponte,Computers,1992-08-11,Springer Science & Business Media,,,380,"A strong and fluent competency in mathematics is a necessary condition for scientific, technological and economic progress. However, it is widely recognized that problem solving, reasoning, and thinking processes are critical areas in which students' performance lags far behind what should be expected and desired. Mathematics is indeed an important subject, but is also important to be able to use it in extra-mathematical contexts. Thinking strictly in terms of mathematics or thinking in terms of its relations with the real world involve quite different processes and issues. This book includes the revised papers presented at the NATO ARW ""Information Technology and Mathematical Problem Solving Research"", held in April 1991, in Viana do Castelo, Portugal, which focused on the implications of computerized learning environments and cognitive psychology research for these mathematical activities. In recent years, several committees, professional associations, and distinguished individuals throughout the world have put forward proposals to renew mathematics curricula, all emphasizing the importance of problem solving. In order to be successful, these reforming intentions require a theory-driven research base.

Wallace,Computers,2012-12-06,Springer Science & Business Media,,,199,"The NATO Advanced Research Workshop (ARW) ""Algorithms and Model Formulations in Mathematical Programming"" was held at Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen, Norway, from June 15 to June 19, 1987. The ARW was organized on behalf of the Committee on Algorithms (COAL) of the Mathematical Programming Society (MPS). Co-directors were Jan Telgen (Van Dien+Co Organisatie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and Roger J-B Wets (The University of California at Davis, USA). 43 participants from 11 countries attended the ARW. The workshop was organized such that each day started with a - minute keynote presentation, followed by a 45-minute plenary discussion. The first part of this book contains the contributions of the five keynote speakers. The plenary discussions were taped, and the transcripts given to the keynote speakers. They have treated the transcripts differently, some by working the discussions into their papers, others by adding a section which sums up the discussions. The plenary discussions were very interesting and stimulating due to active participation of the audience. The five keynote speakers were asked to view the topic of the workshop, the interaction between algorithms and model formulations, from different perspectives. On the first day of the workshop Professor Alexander H.G. Rinnooy Kan (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) put the theme into a larger context by his talk ""Mathematical programming as an intellectual activity"".

Readers learn the mathematics behind the computational aspects of space, shape, transformation, color, rendering, animation, and modeling. The software required is freely available on the Internet for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The text answers questions such as these: How do artists build up realistic shapes from geometric primitives? What computations is my computer doing when it generates a realistic image of my 3D scene? What mathematical tools can I use to animate an object through space? Why do movies always look more realistic than video games? Containing the mathematics and computing needed for making their own 3D computer-generated images and animations, the text, and the course it supports, culminates in a project in which students create a short animated movie using free software. Algebra and trigonometry are prerequisites; calculus is not, though it helps. Programming is not required.

Do we get mathematical objects by abstraction from real objects, or vice versa? Why is mathematics effective into physics?

UiK_EAAAQBAJ,Mathematics For Computation (M4c),"Marco Benini, Olaf Beyersdorff, Michael Rathjen, Peter Michael Schuster",Mathematics,2023-03-21,World Scientific,,,477,"The overall topic of the volume, Mathematics for Computation (M4C), is mathematics taking crucially into account the aspect of computation, investigating the interaction of mathematics with computation, bridging the gap between mathematics and computation wherever desirable and possible, and otherwise explaining why not.Recently, abstract mathematics has proved to have more computational content than ever expected. Indeed, the axiomatic method, originally intended to do away with concrete computations, seems to suit surprisingly well the programs-from-proofs paradigm, with abstraction helping not only clarity but also efficiency.Unlike computational mathematics, which rather focusses on objects of computational nature such as algorithms, the scope of M4C generally encompasses all the mathematics, including abstract concepts such as functions. The purpose of M4C actually is a strongly theory-based and therefore, is a more reliable and sustainable approach to actual computation, up to the systematic development of verified software.While M4C is situated within mathematical logic and the related area of theoretical computer science, in principle it involves all branches of mathematics, especially those which prompt computational considerations. In traditional terms, the topics of M4C include proof theory, constructive mathematics, complexity theory, reverse mathematics, type theory, category theory and domain theory.The aim of this volume is to provide a point of reference by presenting up-to-date contributions by some of the most active scholars in each field. A variety of approaches and techniques are represented to give as wide a view as possible and promote cross-fertilization between different styles and traditions.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UiK_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UiK_EAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UiK_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api

R4Eap3wxpLsC,Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Center for Education, Committee on Early Childhood Mathematics",Education,2009-11-13,National Academies Press,,,399,"Early childhood mathematics is vitally important for young children's present and future educational success. Research demonstrates that virtually all young children have the capability to learn and become competent in mathematics. Furthermore, young children enjoy their early informal experiences with mathematics. Unfortunately, many children's potential in mathematics is not fully realized, especially those children who are economically disadvantaged. This is due, in part, to a lack of opportunities to learn mathematics in early childhood settings or through everyday experiences in the home and in their communities. Improvements in early childhood mathematics education can provide young children with the foundation for school success. Relying on a comprehensive review of the research, Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood lays out the critical areas that should be the focus of young children's early mathematics education, explores the extent to which they are currently being incorporated in early childhood settings, and identifies the changes needed to improve the quality of mathematics experiences for young children. This book serves as a call to action to improve the state of early childhood mathematics. It will be especially useful for policy makers and practitioners-those who work directly with children and their families in shaping the policies that affect the education of young children.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R4Eap3wxpLsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=R4Eap3wxpLsC&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=R4Eap3wxpLsC&pg=PA339&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=58&source=gbs_api

Within the past ten years, however, mathematicians have proven that they hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of our world--and ourselves. In The Mathematics of Life, Ian Stewart provides a fascinating overview of the vital but little-recognized role mathematics has played in pulling back the curtain on the hidden complexities of the natural world--and how its contribution will be even more vital in the years ahead. In his characteristically clear and entertaining fashion, Stewart explains how mathematicians and biologists have come to work together on some of the most difficult scientific problems that the human race has ever tackled, including the nature and origin of life itself.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=31bTnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=31bTnQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=31bTnQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api

Concept of Stability in numerical mathematics opens by examining the stability of finite algorithms. A more precise definition of stability holds for quadrature and interpolation methods, which the following chapters focus on. The discussion then progresses to the numerical treatment of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While one-step methods for ODEs are always stable, this is not the case for hyperbolic or parabolic differential equations, which are investigated next. The final chapters discuss stability for discretisations of elliptic differential equations and integral equations. In comparison among the subfields we discuss the practical importance of stability and the possible conflict between higher consistency order and stability.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mq-9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mq-9BAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mq-9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=125&source=gbs_api

It covers not only standard material but also many interesting topics not usually encountered at this level, such as the theory of solving cubic equations, the use of Euler’s formula to study the five Platonic solids, the use of prime numbers to encode and decode secret information, and the theory of how to compare the sizes of two infinite sets. New to the Third Edition The third edition of this popular text contains three new chapters that provide an introduction to mathematical analysis. These new chapters introduce the ideas of limits of sequences and continuous functions as well as several interesting applications, such as the use of the intermediate value theorem to prove the existence of nth roots. This edition also includes solutions to all of the odd-numbered exercises. By carefully explaining various topics in analysis, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics, this textbook illustrates the power and beauty of basic mathematical concepts. Written in a rigorous yet accessible style, it continues to provide a robust bridge between high school and higher level mathematics, enabling students to study further courses in abstract algebra and analysis.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0nnn5Ewl-jkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0nnn5Ewl-jkC&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0nnn5Ewl-jkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=126&source=gbs_api

x4w9DwAAQBAJ,Humanizing Mathematics and its Philosophy,Bharath Sriraman,Mathematics,2017-11-07,Birkhäuser,,,357,"This Festschrift contains numerous colorful and eclectic essays from well-known mathematicians, philosophers, logicians, and linguists celebrating the 90th birthday of Reuben Hersh. The essays offer, in part, attempts to answer the following questions set forth by Reuben himself as a focus for this volume: Can practicing mathematicians, as such, contribute anything to the philosophy of math? Can or should philosophers of math, as such, say anything to practicing mathematicians? Twenty or fifty years from now, what will be similar, and what will, or could, or should be altogether different: About the philosophy of math? About math education? About math research institutions? About data processing and scientific computing? The essays also offer glimpses into Reuben’s fertile mind and his lasting influence on the mathematical community, as well as revealing the diverse roots, obstacles and philosophical dispositions that characterize the working lives of mathematicians. With contributions from a veritable “who’s who” list of 20th century luminaries from mathematics and philosophy, as well as from Reuben himself, this volume will appeal to a wide variety of readers from curious undergraduates to prominent mathematicians.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x4w9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=x4w9DwAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=x4w9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=154&source=gbs_api

b0d_BwAAQBAJ,Mathematical Mindsets,Jo Boaler,Education,2015-11-02,John Wiley & Sons,,,320,"Banish math anxiety and give students of all ages a clear roadmap to success Mathematical Mindsets provides practical strategies and activities to help teachers and parents show all children, even those who are convinced that they are bad at math, that they can enjoy and succeed in math. Jo Boaler—Stanford researcher, professor of math education, and expert on math learning—has studied why students don't like math and often fail in math classes. She's followed thousands of students through middle and high schools to study how they learn and to find the most effective ways to unleash the math potential in all students. There is a clear gap between what research has shown to work in teaching math and what happens in schools and at home. This book bridges that gap by turning research findings into practical activities and advice. Boaler translates Carol Dweck's concept of 'mindset' into math teaching and parenting strategies, showing how students can go from self-doubt to strong self-confidence, which is so important to math learning. Boaler reveals the steps that must be taken by schools and parents to improve math education for all. Mathematical Mindsets: Explains how the brain processes mathematics learning Reveals how to turn mistakes and struggles into valuable learning experiences Provides examples of rich mathematical activities to replace rote learning Explains ways to give students a positive math mindset Gives examples of how assessment and grading policies need to change to support real understanding Scores of students hate and fear math, so they end up leaving school without an understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Their evasion and departure hinders math-related pathways and STEM career opportunities. Research has shown very clear methods to change this phenomena, but the information has been confined to research journals—until now. Mathematical Mindsets provides a proven, practical roadmap to mathematics success for any student at any age.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b0d_BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=b0d_BwAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=b0d_BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=156&source=gbs_api

It is a translation with updates and editorial comments of the Soviet Mathematical Encyclopaedia published by 'Soviet Encyclopaedia Publishing House' in five volumes in 1977-1985. The annotated translation consists of ten volumes including a special index volume. There are three kinds of articles in this ENCYCLOPAEDIA. First of all there are survey-type articles dealing with the various main directions in mathematics (where a rather fine subdivi sion has been used). The main requirement for these articles has been that they should give a reasonably complete up-to-date account of the current state of affairs in these areas and that they should be maximally accessible. On the whole, these articles should be understandable to mathematics students in their first specialization years, to graduates from other mathematical areas and, depending on the specific subject, to specialists in other domains of science, en gineers and teachers of mathematics. These articles treat their material at a fairly general level and aim to give an idea of the kind of problems, techniques and concepts involved in the area in question. They also contain background and motivation rather than precise statements of precise theorems with detailed definitions and technical details on how to carry out proofs and constructions. The second kind of article, of medium length, contains more detailed concrete problems, results and techniques.",,http://books.google.com/books?id=bYxYvQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bYxYvQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=171&source=gbs_api

8gbgxQEACAAJ,Introduction to the Foundations of Applied Mathematics,Mark H. Holmes,Mathematics,2019-10-15,Springer,,,0,"The objective of this textbook is the construction, analysis, and interpretation of mathematical models to help us understand the world we live in. Rather than follow a case study approach it develops the mathematical and physical ideas that are fundamental in understanding contemporary problems in science and engineering. Science evolves, and this means that the problems of current interest continually change. What does not change as quickly is the approach used to derive the relevant mathematical models, and the methods used to analyze the models. Consequently, this book is written in such a way as to establish the mathematical ideas underlying model development independently of a specific application. This does not mean applications are not considered, they are, and connections with experiment are a staple of this book. The book, as well as the individual chapters, is written in such a way that the material becomes more sophisticated as you progress. This provides some flexibility in how the book is used, allowing consideration for the breadth and depth of the material covered. Moreover, there are a wide spectrum of exercises and detailed illustrations that significantly enrich the material. Students and researchers interested in mathematical modelling in mathematics, physics, engineering and the applied sciences will find this text useful. The material, and topics, have been updated to include recent developments in mathematical modeling. The exercises have also been expanded to include these changes, as well as enhance those from the first edition. Review of first edition: ""The goal of this book is to introduce the mathematical tools needed for analyzing and deriving mathematical models. ... Holmes is able to integrate the theory with application in a very nice way providing an excellent book on applied mathematics. ... One of the best features of the book is the abundant number of exercises found at the end of each chapter. ... I think this is a great book, and I recommend it for scholarly purposes by students, teachers, and researchers.""

UW6BAQAAQBAJ,Mathematics and Climate,"Hans Kaper, Hans Engler",Science,2013-10-18,SIAM,,,303,"Mathematics and Climate is a timely textbook aimed at students and researchers in mathematics and statistics who are interested in current issues of climate science, as well as at climate scientists who wish to become familiar with qualitative and quantitative methods of mathematics and statistics. The authors emphasize conceptual models that capture important aspects of Earth's climate system and present the mathematical and statistical techniques that can be applied to their analysis. Topics from climate science include the Earth?s energy balance, temperature distribution, ocean circulation patterns such as El Ni?o?Southern Oscillation, ice caps and glaciation periods, the carbon cycle, and the biological pump. Among the mathematical and statistical techniques presented in the text are dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, Fourier analysis, conservation laws, regression analysis, and extreme value theory. The following features make Mathematics and Climate a valuable teaching resource: issues of current interest in climate science and sustainability are used to introduce the student to the methods of mathematics and statistics; the mathematical sophistication increases as the book progresses and topics can thus be selected according to interest and level of knowledge; each chapter ends with a set of exercises that reinforce or enhance the material presented in the chapter and stimulate critical thinking and communication skills; and the book contains an extensive list of references to the literature, a glossary of terms for the nontechnical reader, and a detailed index.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UW6BAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UW6BAQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UW6BAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=185&source=gbs_api
Tls9jgEACAAJ,The Didactics of Mathematics: Approaches and Issues,"Bernard R Hodgson, Alain Kuzniak, Jean-Baptiste Lagrange",Education,2016-04-04,Springer,,,0,"This book, the outcome of a conference organised in 2012 in Paris as a homage to Michèle Artigue, is based on the main component of this event. However, it offers more than a mere reflection of the conference in itself, as various well-known researchers from the field have been invited to summarize the main topics where the importance of Artigue’s contribution is unquestionable. Her multiple interest areas, as a researcher involved in a wider community, give to this volume its unique flavour of diversity. Michèle Artigue (ICMI 2013 Felix Klein Award, CIAEM 2015 Luis Santaló Award) is without doubt one of the most influential researchers nowadays in the field of didactics of mathematics. This influence rests both on the quality of her research and on her constant contribution, since the early 1970s, to the development of the teaching and learning of mathematics. Observing her exemplary professional history, one can witness the emergence, the development, and the main issues of didactics of mathematics as a specific research field.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tls9jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Tls9jgEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Tls9jgEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=186&source=gbs_api

This book represents the first purposeful cross-cultural collection of studies to answer this question from teachers’ perspectives. It focuses particularly on how teachers view effective teaching of mathematics. Teachers’ voices are heard and celebrated throughout the studies reported in this volume. These studies are drawn from many parts of the world representing both Eastern and Western cultural traditions. The editors and authors have deliberately included the views of teachers and educators from different cultural backgrounds, taking into account that beliefs on effective mathematics teaching and its features are highly influenced by one’s own culture.

xKWZBwAAQBAJ,Mathematics Education as a Research Domain: A Search for Identity,"Anna Sierpinska, Jeremy Kilpatrick",Education,2013-03-14,Springer,,,244,"No one disputes how important it is, in today's world, to prepare students to un derstand mathematics as well as to use and communicate mathematics in their future lives. That task is very difficult, however. Refocusing curricula on funda mental concepts, producing new teaching materials, and designing teaching units based on 'mathematicians' common sense' (or on logic) have not resulted in a better understanding of mathematics by more students. The failure of such efforts has raised questions suggesting that what was missing at the outset of these proposals, designs, and productions was a more profound knowledge of the phenomena of learning and teaching mathematics in socially established and culturally, politically, and economically justified institutions - namely, schools. Such knowledge cannot be built by mere juxtaposition of theories in disci plines such as psychology, sociology, and mathematics. Psychological theories focus on the individual learner. Theories of sociology of education look at the general laws of curriculum development, the specifics of pedagogic discourse as opposed to scientific discourse in general, the different possible pedagogic rela tions between the teacher and the taught, and other general problems in the inter face between education and society. Mathematics, aside from its theoretical contents, can be looked at from historical and epistemological points of view, clarifying the genetic development of its concepts, methods, and theories. This view can shed some light on the meaning of mathematical concepts and on the difficulties students have in teaching approaches that disregard the genetic development of these concepts.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xKWZBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xKWZBwAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xKWZBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=204&source=gbs_api

XxcJAQAAMAAJ,Young Children as Mathematicians,Dianna Mannigel,Mathematics,1992,,,,256,"This text is for students in early childhood teacher education courses. It focuses on mathematics education with children from three to eight years, in preschool and the early primary grades. It could also be used by teachers wishing to become familiar with maths in these early childhood years. The integration of theory and practice occurs through topics about how children learn, what they learn as young mathematicians, the provision of an appropriate learning environment, and relevant teaching strategies. The text provides a developmental basis for new approaches to mathematics education, and explains how teachers can organise the learning environment so children can construct their own knowledge. It steers a middle course between closed, over-structured teaching and laissez- faire, unsupported experience. Detailed lists of developmental sequences help teachers to identify children's mathematical thinking so they can offer appropriate support at the right time. It offers guidance in the use of curriculum documents from state education departments, for developing a mathematics program. In view of increasing use of games in maths education, a chapter offers not only games, but general principles about the use, purchase and adaptation of games. Each chapter includes activities for students.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxcJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XxcJAQAAMAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XxcJAQAAMAAJ&q=mathematics&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=209&source=gbs_api

buCMEAAAQBAJ,The Meaning of Proofs,Gabriele Lolli,Mathematics,2022-09-27,National Geographic Books,,,0,"Why mathematics is not merely formulaic: an argument that to write a mathematical proof is tantamount to inventing a story. In The Meaning of Proofs, mathematician Gabriele Lolli argues that to write a mathematical proof is tantamount to inventing a story. Lolli offers not instructions for how to write mathematical proofs, but a philosophical and poetic reflection on mathematical proofs as narrative. Mathematics, imprisoned within its symbols and images, Lolli writes, says nothing if its meaning is not narrated in a story. The minute mathematicians open their mouths to explain something—the meaning of x, how to find y—they are framing a narrative. Every proof is the story of an adventure, writes Lolli, a journey into an unknown land to open a new, connected route; once the road is open, we correct it, expand it. Just as fairy tales offer a narrative structure in which new characters can be inserted into recurring forms of the genre in original ways, in mathematics, each new abstract concept is the protagonist of a different theory supported by the general techniques of mathematical reasoning. In ancient Greece, there was more than an analogy between literature and mathematics, there was direct influence. Euclid’s proofs have roots in poetry and rhetoric. Mathematics, Lolli asserts, is not the mere manipulation of formulas.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=buCMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=buCMEAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=buCMEAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=214&source=gbs_api
XfcgPrUIYK4C,Mathematical Physics,"Bruce R. Kusse, Erik A. Westwig",Science,2010-01-05,John Wiley & Sons,,,689,"What sets this volume apart from other mathematics texts is its emphasis on mathematical tools commonly used by scientists and engineers to solve real-world problems. Using a unique approach, it covers intermediate and advanced material in a manner appropriate for undergraduate students. Based on author Bruce Kusse's course at the Department of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University, Mathematical Physics begins with essentials such as vector and tensor algebra, curvilinear coordinate systems, complex variables, Fourier series, Fourier and Laplace transforms, differential and integral equations, and solutions to Laplace's equations. The book moves on to explain complex topics that often fall through the cracks in undergraduate programs, including the Dirac delta-function, multivalued complex functions using branch cuts, branch points and Riemann sheets, contravariant and covariant tensors, and an introduction to group theory. This expanded second edition contains a new appendix on the calculus of variation -- a valuable addition to the already superb collection of topics on offer. This is an ideal text for upper-level undergraduates in physics, applied physics, physical chemistry, biophysics, and all areas of engineering. It allows physics professors to prepare students for a wide range of employment in science and engineering and makes an excellent reference for scientists and engineers in industry. Worked out examples appear throughout the book and exercises follow every chapter.

XoL4CgAAQBAJ,Mental Computation and Estimation,Charalampos Lemonidis,Education,2015-12-01,Routledge,,,289,"Mental calculations and estimations are basic, everyday skills that are essential for real-life arithmetic operations and number sense. This book presents a much needed overview and analysis of mental computation and estimation, drawing on contemporary research and empirical studies that were conducted on students, teachers and adults to cover all aspects of this complex field. Mental Computation and Estimation analyses the implications that are involved in the research, teaching and learning of mathematics and delivers effective practices that will enhance everyday learning for students. Focusing on a range of international research and studies from the School of Nature and Life Mathematics in Greece, it answers a number of important questions including: What mental calculations and estimations are, why they are important and what other mathematical concepts and cognitive behaviors are they related to? What strategies are used on mental additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions and how are multiplication tables learned? What are the new trends in the teaching of mental calculation and estimation? An invaluable resource for all those involved in the practice and research of mathematics education, Mental Computation and Estimation will also be a useful tool for researchers, policy makers and developers of educational programs.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XoL4CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XoL4CgAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XoL4CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=239&source=gbs_api

This is especially true of one equation: ei(pi) + 1 = 0, the brainchild of Leonhard Euler, the Mozart of mathematics. More than two centuries after Euler's death, it is still regarded as a conceptual diamond of unsurpassed beauty. Called Euler's identity or God's equation, it includes just five numbers but represents an astonishing revelation of hidden connections. It ties together everything from basic arithmetic to compound interest, the circumference of a circle, trigonometry, calculus, and even infinity. In David Stipp's hands, Euler's identity formula becomes a contemplative stroll through the glories of mathematics.

Looking beyond the conventional answers—for the sake of truth, beauty, and practical applications—this book offers an eclectic panorama of the lives and values and hopes and fears of mathematicians in the twenty-first century, assembling material from a startlingly diverse assortment of scholarly, journalistic, and pop culture sources. Drawing on his personal experiences and obsessions as well as the thoughts and opinions of mathematicians from Archimedes and Omar Khayyám to such contemporary giants as Alexander Grothendieck and Robert Langlands, Michael Harris reveals the charisma and romance of mathematics as well as its darker side. In this portrait of mathematics as a community united around a set of common intellectual, ethical, and existential challenges, he touches on a wide variety of questions, such as: Are mathematicians to blame for the 2008 financial crisis? How can we talk about the ideas we were born too soon to understand? And how should you react if you are asked to explain number theory at a dinner party? Disarmingly candid, relentlessly intelligent, and richly entertaining, Mathematics without Apologies takes readers on an unapologetic guided tour of the mathematical life, from the philosophy and sociology of mathematics to its reflections in film and popular music, with detours through the mathematical and mystical traditions of Russia, India, medieval Islam, the Bronx, and beyond.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zfmhDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=zfmhDQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=zfmhDQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=258&source=gbs_api

We think the basis for a better arithmetic has long been available, but its versatility has hardly been appreciated, and it has not yet been integrated into the mainstream of mathematics. We refer to the system commonly called 'Clifford Algebra', though we prefer the name 'Geometric Algebm' suggested by Clifford himself. Many distinct algebraic systems have been adapted or developed to express geometric relations and describe geometric structures. Especially notable are those algebras which have been used for this purpose in physics, in particular, the system of complex numbers, the quatemions, matrix algebra, vector, tensor and spinor algebras and the algebra of differential forms. Each of these geometric algebras has some significant advantage over the others in certain applications, so no one of them provides an adequate algebraic structure for all purposes of geometry and physics. At the same time, the algebras overlap considerably, so they provide several different mathematical representations for individual geometrical or physical ideas.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8yVrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8yVrCQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8yVrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=260&source=gbs_api

However, the increasingly large number of specialist journals has generated a du ality gap between the two partners, and this gap is growing wider. Advances in Mechanics and Mathematics (AMMA) is intended to bridge the gap by providing multi-disciplinary publications which fall into the two following complementary categories: 1. An annual book dedicated to the latest developments in mechanics and mathematics; 2. Monographs, advanced textbooks, handbooks, edited vol umes and selected conference proceedings. The AMMA annual book publishes invited and contributed compre hensive reviews, research and survey articles within the broad area of modern mechanics and applied mathematics. Mechanics is understood here in the most general sense of the word, and is taken to embrace relevant physical and biological phenomena involving electromagnetic, thermal and quantum effects and biomechanics, as well as general dy namical systems. Especially encouraged are articles on mathematical and computational models and methods based on mechanics and their interactions with other fields.

goaXzQEACAAJ,A Contemporary Theory of Mathematics Education Research,Tony Brown,Education,2020-12-12,Springer,,,151,"This book by-passes both psychology and sociology to present an original social theory centered on seeing mathematical learning by everyone as an intrinsic dimension of how mathematics develops as a field in support of human activity. Here, mathematics is defined by how we collectively talk about it. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory, the student is seen as participating in the renewal of mathematics through their contributions to our collective gaze on mathematics as the field responds to ever new demands. As such learning takes a critical stance on the standard initiations into current practices often promoted by formal education. In the field of mathematics education, researchers have moved from psychology where individual students were seen as following natural paths of development through existing mathematical knowledge, to socio-cultural models predicated on students being initiated into the human world and understood through the reflective gazes this world has of itself, such as those found in comparisons of student learning in different countries. This book addresses the domain, purpose and functioning of contemporary research in mathematics education and is an original contribution to this theme. The book is aimed at a mathematics education research audience. It continues a dialogue with existing publications, seen widely as a cutting edge and will also be of interest to students and practitioners in the fields of qualitative research, social theory and psychology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=goaXzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=goaXzQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=goaXzQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=276&source=gbs_api
1lbazQEACAAJ,Connecting Mathematics and Mathematics Education,Erich Christian Wittmann,Education,2021-01-09,Springer,,,318,"This Open Access book features a selection of articles written by Erich Ch. Wittmann between 1984 to 2019, which shows how the “design science conception” has been continuously developed over a number of decades. The articles not only describe this conception in general terms, but also demonstrate various substantial learning environments that serve as typical examples. In terms of teacher education, the book provides clear information on how to combine (well-understood) mathematics and methods courses to benefit of teachers. The role of mathematics in mathematics education is often explicitly and implicitly reduced to the delivery of subject matter that then has to be selected and made palpable for students using methods imported from psychology, sociology, educational research and related disciplines. While these fields have made significant contributions to mathematics education in recent decades, it cannot be ignored that mathematics itself, if well understood, provides essential knowledge for teaching mathematics beyond the pure delivery of subject matter. For this purpose, mathematics has to be conceived of as an organism that is deeply rooted in elementary operations of the human mind, which can be seamlessly developed to higher and higher levels so that the full richness of problems of various degrees of difficulty, and different means of representation, problem-solving strategies, and forms of proof can be used in ways that are appropriate for the respective level. This view of mathematics is essential for designing learning environments and curricula, for conducting empirical studies on truly mathematical processes and also for implementing the findings of mathematics education in teacher education, where it is crucial to take systemic constraints into account.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1lbazQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1lbazQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1lbazQEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=277&source=gbs_api

wf7RAQAACAAJ,Focus on Mathematics Education Research,Keith Patterson,Mathematics,2017,Nova Science Publishers,,,0,"Lecturing quality and professional development for lecturers has received growing attention within international undergraduate mathematics forums. The use of videos to inform teacher-practice has been common in research and in pre-service teacher education for many years. However, more recent interest has focused on how videos may be used for professional development of teachers, as separate from the more common research focus. It is indisputable that the verification of the gained knowledge constitutes a significant part of educational process. It not only provides the pupils and their parents with important information on the level of gained capabilities, but it is also a form of control for a teacher who can on the basis of them assess the efficiency of the methods used in the teaching process. Early mathematics education is foundational and attention to quality early math education is vital to ensure students succeed in schools. This book also looks at an innovative approach designed for mathematics in chemistry degree courses, which takes advantage of the Laplace Transform versatility. Strong content knowledge not only allows mathematics teachers to recognize students misconceptions, but it also enables them to direct students to a deeper understanding of the concepts involved. There is empirical evidence to indicate that mathematics teachers who possess deep content knowledge in the subject area tend to have greater repertoire of effective instructional strategies. Since the late eighties, research on the history of mathematics education in Spain has experienced an increase. The increase of calls for research projects both at national and regional level, has contributed to the creation of research groups and it has injected economic resources to research in this field.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wf7RAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wf7RAQAACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wf7RAQAACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=289&source=gbs_api

First, the origins of PISA’s concept of mathematical literacy are discussed, highlighting the underlying themes of mathematics as preparation for life after school and mathematical modelling of the real world, and clarifying PISA’s position within this part of the mathematics education territory. The PISA mathematics framework is introduced as a significant milestone in the development and dissemination of these ideas. The underlying mathematical competencies on which mathematical literacy so strongly depends are described, along with a scheme to use them in item creation and analysis. The development and implementation of the PISA survey and the consequences for the outcomes are thoroughly discussed. Different kinds of items for both paper-based and computer-based PISA surveys are exemplified by many publicly released items along with details of scoring. The novel survey of the opportunity students have had to learn the mathematics promoted through PISA is explained. The book concludes by surveying international impact. It presents viewpoints of mathematics educators on how PISA and its constituent ideas and methods have influenced teaching and learning practices, curriculum arrangements, assessment practices, and the educational debate more generally in fourteen countries.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ue0sBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ue0sBQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ue0sBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=318&source=gbs_api

The Scandal of Father 'The Hermit Clad in Crane Feathers' in R. Brown 'The point of a Pin'. van Gulik's The Chinese Maze Murders. Growing specialization and diversification have brought a host of monographs and textbooks on increasingly specialized topics. However, the ""tree"" of knowledge of mathematics and related fields does not grow only by putting forth new branches. It also happens, quite often in fact, that branches which were thought to be completely disparate are suddenly seen to be related. Further, the kind and level of sophistication of mathematics applied in various sciences has changed drastically in recent years: measure theory is used (non-trivially) in regional and theoretical economics; algebraic geometry interacts with physics; the Minkowsky lemma, coding theory and the structure of water meet one another in packing and covering theory; quantum fields, crystal defects and mathematical programming profit from homotopy theory; Lie algebras are relevant to filtering; and prediction and electrical engineering can use Stein spaces. And in addition to this there are such new emerging subdisciplines as ""experimental mathematics"", ""CFD"", ""completely integrable systems"", ""chaos, synergetics and large-scale order"", which are almost impossible to fit into the existing classification schemes.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qrQrAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=qrQrAAAAYAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=qrQrAAAAYAAJ&q=mathematics&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=345&source=gbs_api

Partendo dall'esperienza di applicazione del metodo ai bambini in età scolare, l'autore dimostra come esso possa essere applicato anche a studenti delle università. Il testo è diviso in due parti: nella prima è illustrato il lavoro preliminare di ricerca seguito da un'esposizione più specifica del metodo e dei suoi principi teorici. La seconda parte ha un contenuto pratico nella quale sono indicati i criteri di valutazione dei test, suddivisi nelle principali materie all'epoca studiate nei college americani. L'opera è il risultato del lavoro di ricerca sperimentale condotto dall'autore grazie al quale ha conseguito il suo secondo titolo accademico presso l'Università della Columbia, nel 1922.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4BoFAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4BoFAAAAMAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4BoFAAAAMAAJ&q=mathematics&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=365&source=gbs_api

O4meEAAAQBAJ,Mathematica Beyond Mathematics,José Guillermo Sánchez León,Science,2022-12-19,CRC Press,,,459,"Although many books have been written about Mathematica, very few of them cover the new functionality added to the most recent versions of the program. This thoroughly revised second edition of Mathematica Beyond Mathematics: The Wolfram Language in the Real World introduces the new features using real-world examples based on the experience of the author as a consultant and Wolfram certified instructor. The examples strike a balance between relevance and difficulty in terms of Mathematica syntax, allowing readers to incrementally build up their Mathematica skills as they go through the chapters While reading this book, you will also learn more about the Wolfram Language and how to use it to solve a wide variety of problems. The author raises questions from a wide range of topics and answers them by taking full advantage of Mathematica's latest features. For example: What sources of energy does the world really use? Are our cities getting warmer? Is the novel El Quixote written in Pi? Is it possible to reliably date the Earth using radioactive isotopes? How can we find planets outside our solar system? How can we model epidemics, earthquakes and other natural phenomena? What is the best way to compare organisms genetically? This new edition introduces the new capabilities added to the latest version of Mathematica (version 13), and discusses new topics related to machine learning, big data, finance economics, and physics. New to the Second Edition Separate sections containing carefully selected additional resources that can be accessed from either Mathematica or online Online Supplementary materials including code snippets used in the book and additional examples.

This work brings together experts in mathematical modelling from across Canada and the world, presenting the latest modelling methods as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic. A primary aim of this book is to make the content accessible so that researchers share the core methods that may be applied elsewhere. The mathematical theories and technologies in this book can be used to support decision makers on critical issues such as projecting outbreak trajectories, evaluating public health interventions for infection prevention and control, developing optimal strategies to return to a new normal, and designing vaccine candidates and informing mass immunization program. Topical coverage includes: basic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) modelling framework modified and applied to COVID-19 disease transmission dynamics; nearcasting and forecasting for needs of critical medical resources including personal protective equipment (PPE); predicting COVID-19 mortality; evaluating effectiveness of convalescent plasma treatment and the logistic implementation challenges; estimating impact of delays in contact tracing; quantifying heterogeneity in contact mixing and its evaluation with social distancing; modelling point of care diagnostics of COVID-19; and understanding non-reporting and underestimation. Further, readers will have the opportunity to learn about current modelling methodologies and technologies for emerging infectious disease outbreaks, pandemic mitigation rapid response, and the mathematics behind them. The volume will help the general audience and experts to better understand the important role that mathematics has been playing during this on-going crisis in supporting critical decision-making by governments and public health agencies.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rg-NzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rg-NzgEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rg-NzgEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=415&source=gbs_api

Each chapter unpacks ways in which MTEs use theoretical perspectives to inform their construction of goals, activities designed to address those goals, facilitation of activities, and ways in which MTEs make sense of experiences prospective teachers have as a result. The book is organized in seven sections that highlight how the theoretical perspective of the instructor impacts scholarly inquiry and practice. The final section provides insight as we look backward to reflect, and forward with excitement, moving with the strength of the variation we found in our stories and the feeling of solidarity that results in our understandings of purposes for and insight into teaching mathematics methods. This book can serve as a resource for MTEs as they discuss and construct scholarly practices and as they undertake scholarly inquiry as a means to systematically examine their practice.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z885DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z885DwAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z885DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=426&source=gbs_api

glCMuwEACAAJ,A Course in Mathematics for Students of Physics:,"Paul Bamberg, Shlomo Sternberg",Mathematics,1990-05-25,Cambridge University Press,,,461,"This textbook, available in two volumes, has been developed from a course taught at Harvard over the last decade. The course covers principally the theory and physical applications of linear algebra and of the calculus of several variables, particularly the exterior calculus. The authors adopt the 'spiral method' of teaching, covering the same topic several times at increasing levels of sophistication and range of application. Thus the reader develops a deep, intuitive understanding of the subject as a whole, and an appreciation of the natural progression of ideas. Topics covered include many items previously dealt with at a much more advanced level, such as algebraic topology (introduced via the analysis of electrical networks), exterior calculus, Lie derivatives, and star operators (which are applied to Maxwell's equations and optics). This then is a text which breaks new ground in presenting and applying sophisticated mathematics in an elementary setting. Any student, interpreted in the widest sense, with an interest in physics and mathematics, will gain from its study.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=glCMuwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=glCMuwEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=glCMuwEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=440&source=gbs_api
EFBlkgEACAAJ,Symmetry and the Standard Model,Matthew Robinson,Science,2011-08-17,Springer,,,327,"While theoretical particle physics is an extraordinarily fascinating field, the incredibly fast pace at which it moves along, combined with the huge amount of background information necessary to perform cutting edge research, poses a formidable challenge for graduate students. This book represents the first in a series designed to assist students in the process of transitioning from coursework to research in particle physics. Rather than reading literally dozens of physics and mathematics texts, trying to assimilate the countless ideas, translate notations and perspectives, and see how it all fits together to get a holistic understanding, this series provides a detailed overview of the major mathematical and physical ideas in theoretical particle physics. Ultimately the ideas will be presented in a unified, consistent, holistic picture, where each topic is built firmly on what has come before, and all topics are related in a clear and intuitive way. This introductory text on quantum field theory and particle physics provides both a self-contained and complete introduction to not only the necessary physical ideas, but also a complete introduction to the necessary mathematical tools. Assuming minimal knowledge of undergraduate physics and mathematics, this book lays both the mathematical and physical groundwork with clear, intuitive explanations and plenty of examples. The book then continues with an exposition of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the theory that currently seems to explain the universe apart from gravity. Furthermore, this book was written as a primer for the more advanced mathematical and physical ideas to come later in this series.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EFBlkgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EFBlkgEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EFBlkgEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=441&source=gbs_api

A study of the mathematics used in science is thus asound intellectual investment for training as scientists and engineers. This first volume of two is centered on methods of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and the special functions introduced. Solving PDEs can't be done, however, outside of the context in which they apply to physical systems. The solutions to PDEs must conform to boundary conditions, a set of additional constraints in space or time to be satisfied at the boundaries of the system, that small part of the universe under study. The first volume is devoted to homogeneous boundary-value problems (BVPs), homogeneous implying a system lacking a forcing function, or source function. The second volume takes up (in addition to other topics) inhomogeneous problems where, in addition to the intrinsic PDE governing a physical field, source functions are an essential part of the system. This text is based on a course offered at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and while produced for NPS needs, it will serve other universities well. It is based on the assumption that it follows a math review course, and was designed to coincide with the second quarter of student study, which is dominated by BVPs but also requires an understanding of special functions and Fourier analysis.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nD9iDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nD9iDwAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nD9iDwAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=453&source=gbs_api

T162DAAAQBAJ,"Mathematics That Power Our World, The: How Is It Made?","Joseph Khoury, Gilles Lamothe",Mathematics,2016-05-12,World Scientific,,,202,"The Mathematics That Power Our World: How Is It Made? is an attempt to unveil the hidden mathematics behind the functioning of many of the devices we use on a daily basis. For the past years, discussions on the best approach in teaching and learning mathematics have shown how much the world is divided on this issue. The one reality we seem to agree on globally is the fact that our new generation is lacking interest and passion for the subject. One has the impression that the vast majority of young students finishing high school or in their early post-secondary studies are more and more divided into two main groups when it comes to the perception of mathematics. The first group looks at mathematics as a pure academic subject with little connection to the real world. The second group considers mathematics as a set of tools that a computer can be programmed to use and thus, a basic knowledge of the subject is sufficient. This book serves as a middle ground between these two views. Many of the elegant and seemingly theoretical concepts of mathematics are linked to state-of-the-art technologies. The topics of the book are selected carefully to make that link more relevant. They include: digital calculators, basics of data compression and the Huffman coding, the JPEG standard for data compression, the GPS system studied both from the receiver and the satellite ends, image processing and face recognition.This book is a great resource for mathematics educators in high schools, colleges and universities who want to engage their students in advanced readings that go beyond the classroom discussions. It is also a solid foundation for anyone thinking of pursuing a career in science or engineering. All efforts were made so that the exposition of each topic is as clear and self-contained as possible and thus, appealing to anyone trying to broaden his mathematical horizons.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T162DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=T162DAAAQBAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=T162DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=458&source=gbs_api

Building on their close observation of primary mathematics classrooms, the authors provide those starting out in the teaching profession with a four-stage framework which acts as a tool of support for developing their teaching: - making sense of foundation knowledge - focusing on what teachers know about mathematics - transforming knowledge - representing mathematics to learners through examples, analogies, illustrations and demonstrations - connection - helping learners to make sense of mathematics through understanding how ideas and concepts are linked to each other - contingency - what to do when the unexpected happens Each chapter includes practical activities, lesson descriptions and extracts of classroom transcripts to help teachers reflect on effective practice.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Klw_AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Klw_AQAAIAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Klw_AQAAIAAJ&q=mathematics&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=459&source=gbs_api

Symposium on Interactive Systems for Experimental Mathematics, held in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the ACM National Meeting. This book is organized into five parts encompassing 46 chapters. The opening part deals with the general criteria for interactive on-line systems that seem most important for the experimental solution of mathematical problems. This part specifically describes the AMTRAN, REDUCE, EASL, POSE, VENUS, and CHARYBDIS computer systems and languages. The next two parts cover the components of interactive systems, including coherent programming, interactive console, mathematical symbol processing, message system, and computer-aided instruction. The fourth part examines a scheme for permitting a user of conventional procedural programming languages, namely, FORTRAN, to test actual error propagation in numerical calculations. This part also describes the features of Analyst Assistance Program, an on-line graphically oriented conversational computing system designed to perform small nonrecurring numerical computations. The concluding part presents several implications of selected computer systems, the resulting problems, and their proposed solutions.

HnxAtAEACAAJ,Structure and Randomness,Terence Tao,Mathematics,2008,Amer Mathematical Society,,,298,"There are many bits and pieces of folklore in mathematics that are passed down from advisor to student, or from collaborator to collaborator, but which are too fuzzy and non-rigorous to be discussed in the formal literature. Traditionally, it was a matter of luck and location as to who learned such folklore mathematics. But today, such bits and pieces can be communicated effectively and efficiently via the semiformal medium of research blogging. This book grew from such a blog.In 2007, Terry Tao began a mathematical blog, as an outgrowth of his own website at UCLA. This book is based on a selection of articles from the first year of that blog. These articles discuss a wide range of mathematics and its applications, ranging from expository articles on quantum mechanics, Einstein's equation E = mc2, or compressed sensing, to open problems in analysis, combinatorics, geometry, number theory, and algebra, to lecture series on random matrices, Fourier analysis, or the dichotomy between structure and randomness that is present in many subfields of mathematics, to more philosophical discussions on such topics as the interplay between finitary and infinitary in analysis.Some selected commentary from readers of the blog has also been included at the end of each article. While the articles vary widely in subject matter and level, they should be broadly accessible to readers with a general graduate mathematics background; the focus in many articles is on the 'big picture' and on informal discussion, with technical details largely being left to the referenced literature.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HnxAtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HnxAtAEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HnxAtAEACAAJ&dq=mathematics&hl=&cd=474&source=gbs_api

fk1jDgAAQBAJ,Mestizos Come Home!,Robert Con Davis-Undiano,History,2017-03-30,University of Oklahoma Press,,,337,"Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano has described U.S. and Latin American culture as continually hobbled by amnesia—unable, or unwilling, to remember the influence of mestizos and indigenous populations. In Mestizos Come Home! author Robert Con Davis-Undiano documents the great awakening of Mexican American and Latino culture since the 1960s that has challenged this omission in collective memory. He maps a new awareness of the United States as intrinsically connected to the broader context of the Americas. At once native and new to the American Southwest, Mexican Americans have “come home” in a profound sense: they have reasserted their right to claim that land and U.S. culture as their own. Mestizos Come Home! explores key areas of change that Mexican Americans have brought to the United States. These areas include the recognition of mestizo identity, especially its historical development across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the re-emergence of indigenous relationships to land; and the promotion of Mesoamerican conceptions of the human body. Clarifying and bridging critical gaps in cultural history, Davis-Undiano considers important artifacts from the past and present, connecting the casta (caste) paintings of eighteenth-century Mexico to modern-day artists including John Valadez, Alma López, and Luis A. Jiménez Jr. He also examines such community celebrations as Day of the Dead, Cinco de Mayo, and lowrider car culture as examples of mestizo influence on mainstream American culture. Woven throughout is the search for meaning and understanding of mestizo identity. A large-scale landmark account of Mexican American culture, Mestizos Come Home! shows that mestizos are essential to U.S. national culture. As an argument for social justice and a renewal of America’s democratic ideals, this book marks a historic cultural homecoming.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA279&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api

8LFsPwN2AJIC,Reload,"Mary Flanagan, Austin Booth",Social Science,2002-05-03,MIT Press,,,604,"An anthology of feminist cyberfiction and theoretical and critical writings on gender and technoculture. Most writing on cyberculture is dominated by two almost mutually exclusive visions: the heroic image of the male outlaw hacker and the utopian myth of a gender-free cyberworld. Reload offers an alternative picture of cyberspace as a complex and contradictory place where there is oppression as well as liberation. It shows how cyberpunk's revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women's cyberfiction—fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies—and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women's lives. They also explore the feminist implications of the cyborg, a human-machine hybrid. The writers challenge the conceptual and institutional rifts between high and low culture, which are embedded in the texts and artifacts of cyberculture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&pg=PA377&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api

Pilkington explores the forms and functions of the voices of scientists in books written for non-professionals. This study confirms the importance of considering presentation of discourse outside of literary fiction: popular science uses presented discourse in ways uncommon for fiction yet not conventional for non-fiction either. This analysis is an acknowledgement of the social consequences of popularization. Discourse presentation of scientists reconstructs the world of the scientific community as a human space but also projects back into it an image of the scientist the public wants to see. At the same time, Pilkington’s findings strengthen the view of popularization that rejects the notion of a strict divide between professional and popular science.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api

M6JhDwAAQBAJ,Fiction's Overcoat,Edith W. Clowes,Literary Criticism,2018-07-05,Cornell University Press,,,318,"If Dostoevsky claimed that all Russian writers of his day ""came out from Gogol's 'Overcoat,'"" then Edith W. Clowes boldly expands his dramatic image to describe the emergence of Russian philosophy out from under the ""overcoat"" of Russian literature. In Fiction's Overcoat, Clowes responds to the view, commonly held by Western European and North American thinkers, that Russian culture has no philosophical tradition. If that is true, she asks, why do readers everywhere turn to the classics of Russian literature, at least in part because Russian writers so famously engage universal questions, because they are so ""philosophical""? Her answer to this question is a lively and comprehensive volume that details the origins, submergence, and re-emergence of a rich and vital Russian philosophical tradition.During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Russian philosophy emerged in conversation with narrative fiction, radical journalism, and speculative theology, developing a distinct cultural discourse with its own claim to authority and truth. Leading Russian thinkers—Berdiaev, Losev, Rozanov, Shestov, and Solovyov—made philosophy the primary forum in which Russians debated metaphysical, aesthetic, and ethical questions as well as issues of individual and national identity. That debate was tragically truncated by the events of 1917 and the rise of the Soviet empire. Today, after seventy years of enforced silence, this particularly Russian philosophical culture has resurfaced. Fiction's Overcoat serves as a welcome guide to its complexities and nuances.Historians and cultural critics will find in Clowes's book the story of the increasing refinement and diversification of Russian cultural discourse, philosophers will find an alternative to the Western philosophical tradition, and students of literature will enjoy the opportunity to rethink the great Russian novelists—particularly Dostoevsky, Pasternak, and Platonov—as important voices in the process of shaping and sustaining a new philosophy and ensuring its survival into our own age.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M6JhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M6JhDwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M6JhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api
FPdRAwAAQBAJ,Encyclopedia of the Novel,Paul Schellinger,Literary Criticism,2014-04-08,Routledge,3,2,838,"The Encyclopedia of the Novel is the first reference book that focuses on the development of the novel throughout the world. Entries on individual writers assess the place of that writer within the development of the novel form, explaining why and in exactly what ways that writer is importnant. Similarly, an entry on an individual novel discusses the importance of that novel not only form, analyzing the particular innovations that novel has introduced and the ways in which it has influenced the subsequent course of the genre. A wide range of topic entries explore the history, criticism, theory, production, dissemination and reception of the novel. A very important component of the Encyclopedia of the Novel is its long surveys of development of the novel in various regions of the world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FPdRAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FPdRAwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FPdRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1194&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api
j_pADwAAQBAJ,Idealism,"Tyron Goldschmidt, Kenneth L. Pearce",Philosophy,2017,Oxford University Press,,,314,"Idealism is a family of metaphysical views each of which gives priority to the mental. The best-known forms of idealism in Western philosophy are Berkeleyan idealism, which gives ontological priority to the mental (minds and ideas) over the physical (bodies), and Kantian idealism, which gives a kind of explanatory priority to the mental (the structure of the understanding) over the physical (the structure of the empirical world). Although idealism was once a dominant view in Western philosophy, it has suffered almost total neglect over the last several decades. This book rectifies this situation by bringing together seventeen essays by leading philosophers on the topic of metaphysical idealism. The various essays explain, attack, or defend a variety of idealistic theories, including not only Berkeleyan and Kantian idealisms but also those developed in traditions less familiar to analytic philosophers, including Buddhism and Hassidic Judaism. Although a number of the articles draw on historical sources, all will be of interest to philosophers working in contemporary metaphysics. This volume aims to spark a revival of serious philosophical interest in metaphysical idealism.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&pg=PA165&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api

In how far did the daunting narratives surrounding legendary magicians such as Theophilus of Adana, Cyprianus of Antioch, Johann Georg Faust or Agrippa of Nettesheim rely on real-world events or practices? Fourteen original case studies present material from late antiquity to the twenty-first century and explore these questions in a systematic manner. By coining the notion of ‘fictional practice’, the editors discuss the emergence of novel, imaginative types of magic from the nineteenth century onwards when fiction and practice came to be more and more intertwined or even fully amalgamated. This is the first comparative study that systematically relates fiction and practice in the history of magic.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NLJFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NLJFEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NLJFEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA352&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api

Simpson, longtime co-editor of The Southern Review and an established authority on Southern literature. The two long conversations with Professor Simpson place the post World War II Southern novel in the context of modern literature and of the classical Southern novel. Professor Simpson, who knew many of the giants of Southern literature, assesses the writers of the past and the possibilities of the future. The volume includes conversations with Ernest Gaines, Madison Jones, Shirley Ann Grau, David Madden, the late John William Corrington, James Wilcox, and Vance Bourjaily.

cLJlAAAAMAAJ,Dying Planet,Robert Markley,Fiction,2005-09-08,Duke University Press Books,,,464,"For more than a century, Mars has been at the center of debates about humanity’s place in the cosmos. Focusing on perceptions of the red planet in scientific works and science fiction, Dying Planet analyzes the ways Mars has served as a screen onto which humankind has projected both its hopes for the future and its fears of ecological devastation on Earth. Robert Markley draws on planetary astronomy, the history and cultural study of science, science fiction, literary and cultural criticism, ecology, and astrobiology to offer a cross-disciplinary investigation of the cultural and scientific dynamics that have kept Mars on front pages since the 1800s. Markley interweaves chapters on science and science fiction, enabling him to illuminate each arena and to explore the ways their concerns overlap and influence one another. He tracks all the major scientific developments, from observations through primitive telescopes in the seventeenth century to data returned by the rovers that landed on Mars in 2004. Markley describes how major science fiction writers—H. G. Wells, Kim Stanley Robinson, Philip K. Dick, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, and Judith Merril—responded to new theories and new controversies. He also considers representations of Mars in film, on the radio, and in the popular press. In its comprehensive study of both science and science fiction, Dying Planet reveals how changing conceptions of Mars have had crucial consequences for understanding ecology on Earth.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cLJlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cLJlAAAAMAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cLJlAAAAMAAJ&q=fiction&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=226&source=gbs_api

kQIQAAAAYAAJ,Tales of the Supernatural in Early Modern Japan,Noriko T. Reider,Literary Criticism,2002,,,,212,"This book is intended to assess the significance of kaidan, specifically its multi-dimensional reflection of an impact on Japanese culture in the Edo period. The legacy of Japan's cultural efflorescence in the late eighteenth century was far-reaching, its fruits often seen as epitomizing the entire Tokugawa period. In the years between the Kan'en era (1748-1751) and the chilling effects of the Kansei Reforms (1790), there was no dearth of innovative belletristic expression, but in the area of fiction, the yomihon of Ueda Akinari (1734-1809) eclipse all else. Professor Reider's outstanding study treats this unusual scion of a remarkable age, contextualizing his work from a unique perspective. Under various noms de plume, Akinari authored significant works in several genres of both poetry and prose, but his greatest opus is incontrovertibly his Ugetsu monogatari (Tales of Moonlight and Rain), a collection of nine stories that revolutionized tales of the supernatural, elevating the genre to unprecedented levels of style and sophistication.

vIJGAAAAMAAJ,European Readings of American Popular Culture,"John R. Dean, Jean-Paul Gabilliet",History,1996,Praeger,,,296,"Since the Second World War, Europe has undergone a continual invasion: wave after wave of American popular culture. The diffusion of American culture in Europe is both a European story about America and an American story about Europe. This work examines this cross-cultural phenomenon from the European viewpoint. Nearly two dozen European experts in their respective fields offer an invigorating, engaging, and open-minded examination of America as perceived with the acute insight of the interested European outsider—a fruitful tradition that stretches back to Lafayette, de Tocqueville, and Goethe, to name three. Of interest to scholars, students, and general readers alike. The book's focus is both sensuous and intellectual: how America is seen (The Image); heard (Popular Music); perused (The Written Word); digested (Food); learned from its common ways (Social Customs); perceived by minorities (Ethnic Cultures); and taken as an instrument of change (Americanization). It is the first book of its kind published in the United States. It is rich with selected, up-to-date critical bibliographies in areas for which very little information is otherwise available. In sum: a cogent, cross-cultural analysis of how U.S. popular culture exposes both European dreams of well-being and nightmares of discontent. These are insights which deserve to be savored.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vIJGAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vIJGAAAAMAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vIJGAAAAMAAJ&q=fiction&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=269&source=gbs_api

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Nobel Prize-winning author J. M. Coetzee's new book follows a young biographer as he works on a book about the late writer, John Coetzee. The biographer embarks on a series of interviews with people who were important to Coetzee during the period when he was ""finding his feet as a writer""-in his thirties and sharing a run-down cottage in the suburbs of Cape Town with his widowed father. Their testimonies create an image of an awkward, reserved, and bookish young man who finds it difficult to connect with the people around him. An innovative and inspired work of fiction-incisive, elegant, and often surprisingly funny- Summertime allows one of the most revered writers of our time to imagine his own life with a critical and unsparing eye.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=304&source=gbs_api

Thomas wound up writing about their world in a seminal work, The Harmless People (1959). It has never gone out of print. Back then, this was uncharted territory and little was known about our human origins. Today, our beginnings are better understood. And after a lifetime of interest in the bushmen, Thomas has come to see that their lifestyle reveals great, hidden truths about human evolution. As she displayed in her bestseller, The Hidden Life of Dogs, Thomas has a rare gift for giving voice to the voices we don#x19;t usually listen to, and helps us see the path that we have taken in our human journey. In The Old Way, she shows how the skills and customs of the hunter-gatherer share much in common with the survival tactics of our animal predecessors. And since it is ""knowledge, not objects, that endure"" over time, Thomas vividly brings us to see how linked we are to our origins in the animal kingdom.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nvgRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nvgRAAAAYAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nvgRAAAAYAAJ&q=fiction&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=324&source=gbs_api

The writers in this anthology discuss some of the most debated questions in this context, such as different conceptions of point of view in narrative fiction, historical counterfactual fiction, the relationship between fact and fiction in historiography, how to understand and analyze statements about an individual's belief perspective, and how everyday discourse is anchored in perspective views of the world.",,http://books.google.com/books?id=uhg6cAAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uhg6cAAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=330&source=gbs_api

ZvsQwAEACAAJ,The Law and the Lady,Wilkie Collins,Uncategorized,2018-12-18,Independently Published,,,776,"Valeria Woodville's first act as a married woman is to sign her name in the marriage register incorrectly, and this slip is followed by the gradual disclosure of a series of secrets about her husband's earlier life, each of which leads on to another set of questions and enigmas. Her discoveries prompt her to defy her husband's authority, to take the law into into a labyrinthine maze of false clues and deceptive identities, in which the exploration of the tangled workings of the mind becomes linked to an investigation into the masquerades of femininity. Probably the first full-length novel with a woman detective as its heroine, The Law and the Lady is a fascinating example of Collins's later fiction. First published in 1875, it employs many of the techniques used in The Moonstone, developing them in bizarre and unexpected ways, and in its Gothic and fantastic elements The Law and the Lady adds a significant dimension to the history of detective fiction.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZvsQwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvsQwAEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvsQwAEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=337&source=gbs_api

The novel centres on the Ramsays and their visits to the Isle of Skye in Scotland between 1910 and 1920. Following and extending the tradition of modernist novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, the plot of To the Lighthouse is secondary to its philosophical introspection. Cited as a key example of the literary technique of multiple focalization, the novel includes little dialogue and almost no action; most of it is written as thoughts and observations. The novel recalls childhood emotions and highlights adult relationships. Among the book's many tropes and themes are those of loss, subjectivity, the nature of art and the problem of perception.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fbruswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fbruswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fbruswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=342&source=gbs_api

xzH2G-8hIQwC,RUBURY:NOVELTY OF NEWSPAPERS P,Matthew Rubery,Language Arts & Disciplines,2009-06-01,"Oxford University Press, USA",,,245,"Rapid industrialization and new advances in technology marked the Victorian period as one of prodigious socio-cultural change. Chief among the many transformations of quotidian life was the swift and widespread dissemination of information made possible by the emergence of the daily newspaper, an unprecedented new media. The changes it wrought in politics, history, and advertising of the age have all been well-documented. But its influence on one area remains overlooked: the Victorian novel. Redressing this oversight, The Novelty of Newspapers highlights the variety of ways the changing world of nineteenth-century journalism shaped the period's most popular literary form. Arising in the 1800s and soon drawing a million readers a day, the commercial press profoundly influenced the work of Bronte, Braddon, Dickens, Conrad, James, Trollope, and others who mined print journalism for fictional techniques. Five of the most important of these narrative conventions-the shipping intelligence, personal advertisement, leading article, interview, and foreign correspondence-show how the Victorian novel is best understood alongside the simultaneous development of newspapers. In highly original analyses of Victorian fiction, this study also captures the surprising ways in which public media enabled the expression of private feeling among ordinary readers: from the trauma caused by a lover's reported suicide to the vicarious gratification felt during a celebrity interview; from the distress at finding one's behavior the subject of unflattering editorial commentary to the apprehension of distant cultures through the foreign correspondence. Combining a wealth of historical research with a series of astute close readings, The Novelty of Newspapers breaks down the assumed divide between the epoch's literature and journalism and demonstrates that newsprint was integral to the development of the novel.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xzH2G-8hIQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xzH2G-8hIQwC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xzH2G-8hIQwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=344&source=gbs_api

l3-XTkaEqAkC,Look at the Birdie,Kurt Vonnegut,Fiction,2010-09-07,Dial Press Trade Paperback,,,274,"“Relentlessly fun to read.”—Dave Eggers • A collection of fourteen previously unpublished short stories from one of the most original writers in all of American fiction In this series of perfectly rendered vignettes, written just as he was starting to find his comic voice, Kurt Vonnegut paints a warm, wise, and funny portrait of life in post–World War II America—a world where squabbling couples, high school geniuses, misfit office workers, and small-town lotharios struggle to adapt to changing technology, moral ambiguity, and unprecedented affluence. Here are tales both cautionary and hopeful, each brimming with Vonnegut’s trademark humor and profound humanism. A family learns the downside of confiding their deepest secrets into a magical invention. A man finds himself in a Kafkaesque world of trouble after he runs afoul of the shady underworld boss who calls the shots in an upstate New York town. A quack psychiatrist turned “murder counselor” concocts a novel new outlet for his paranoid patients. While these stories reflect the anxieties of the postwar era that Vonnegut was so adept at capturing—and provide insight into the development of his early style—collectively, they have a timeless quality that makes them just as relevant today as when they were written. It’s impossible to imagine any of these pieces flowing from the pen of another writer; each in its own way is unmistakably, quintessentially Vonnegut. Featuring a foreword by author and longtime Vonnegut confidant Sidney Offit and illustrated with Vonnegut’s characteristically insouciant line drawings, Look at the Birdie is an unexpected gift for readers who thought his unique voice had been stilled forever—and serves as a terrific introduction to his short fiction for anyone who has yet to experience his genius. Includes these never-before-published stories: “Confido” “FUBAR” “Shout About It from the Housetops” “Ed Luby’s Key Club” “A Song for Selma” “Hall of Mirrors” “The Nice Little People” “Hello, Red” “Little Drops of Water” “The Petrified Ants” “The Honor of a Newsboy” “Look at the Birdie” “King and Queen of the Universe” “The Good Explainer” “[Look at the Birdie] brings us the late writer’s young voice as he skewers—sometimes gently, always lethally—post World War II America.”—The Boston Globe",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3-XTkaEqAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=l3-XTkaEqAkC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=l3-XTkaEqAkC&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=351&source=gbs_api

8oMcEAAAQBAJ,Unless the Threat of Death is Behind Them,John T. Irwin,Literary Criticism,2006-10-25,JHU Press,,,445,"The noted literary critic delves into the psychology and significance of American hardboiled crime fiction and film noir of the 1930s and ’40s. Early in the twentieth century, American crime novelists like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler put forward a new kind of character: the “hard-boiled” detective, as exemplified by Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. Unlike the analytical detectives of nineteenth-century fiction, these new detectives encountered cases not as intricate logical puzzles but as stark challenges of manhood. John T. Irwin explores how the stories of these characters grapple with ideas of American masculinity. Professional codes are pitted against personal desires, resulting in either ruinous relationships or solitary integrity. In thematic conflicts between independence and subordination, all notions of manly independence prove subordinate to the hand of fate. Tracing the stylistic development of the genre, Irwin demonstrates the particular influence of the novel of manners, especially the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He also shows that as hard-boiled fiction began to appear on the screen in film noir, it took on themes of female empowerment—just as women entered the workforce in large numbers. Finally, he discusses how these themes persist in contemporary dramatic series on television, representing the conflicted lives of Americans into the twenty-first century.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oMcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8oMcEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8oMcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=365&source=gbs_api

jG3XDgAAQBAJ,Narrative Framing in Contemporary American Novels,Sławomir Studniarz,Literary Criticism,2017-05-11,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,,,192,"This volume examines a range of novels and novellas published over the course of nearly forty years, from 1968 to 2014, including E.L. Doctorow’s Andrew’s Brain, John Gardner’s “The King’s Indian,” Paul Auster’s Travels in the Scriptorium, Peter Straub’s Mr. X, and Joyce Carol Oates’ Expensive People. These texts display one crucial unifying thread: they are doubly-mediated fictions, fictions in parentheses, so to speak. The application of narrative framing and embedding has been commonly acknowledged and abundantly researched in various works belonging to the Western literary heritage. However, its use in the twentieth and twenty-first century fiction has not been adequately explored, perhaps with the exception of the literary creations of such giants as Vladimir Nabokov and John Barth. Despite this critical oversight, narrative frames prove to be a major resource for modern-day novelists, who adapt this literary device and very effectively put it to their own uses. The essays collected in this volume will serve to spark the revival of interest in this time-honored narrative tool, demonstrating its validity for research into more recently created novels.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jG3XDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jG3XDgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jG3XDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=369&source=gbs_api

FwtqzQEACAAJ,The Invisible Man,Herbert George Wells,Uncategorized,2020-02-06,,,,336,"The Invisible Man is an 1897 science fiction novella by H.G. Wells. Wells' novel was originally serialised in Pearson's Magazine in 1897, and published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who theorises that if a person's refractive index is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will be invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, becoming mentally unstable as a result.Herbert George Wells, better known as H. G. Wells, was an English writer best known for such science fiction novels as The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man and The Island of Doctor Moreau. He was a prolific writer of both fiction and non-fiction, and produced works in many different genres, including contemporary novels, history, and social commentary. He was also an outspoken socialist. His later works become increasingly political and didactic, and only his early science fiction novels are widely read today. Wells, along with Hugo Gernsback and Jules Verne, is sometimes referred to as ""The Father of Science Fiction"".",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FwtqzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FwtqzQEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FwtqzQEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=373&source=gbs_api

Duvall,Literary Criticism,2011-12-08,Cambridge University Press,,,473,"Each generation revises literary history and this is nowhere more evident than in the post-Second World War period. This 2011 Companion offers a comprehensive, authoritative and accessible overview of the diversity of American fiction since the Second World War. Essays by nineteen distinguished scholars provide critical insights into the significant genres, historical contexts, cultural diversity and major authors during a period of enormous American global political and cultural power. This power is overshadowed, nevertheless, by national anxieties growing out of events ranging from the Civil Rights Movement to the rise of feminism; from the Cold War and its fear of Communism and nuclear warfare to the Age of Terror and its different yet related fears of the 'Other'. American fiction since 1945 has faithfully chronicled these anxieties. An essential reference guide, this Companion provides a chronology of the period, as well as guides to further reading.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AVXPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AVXPAgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AVXPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=379&source=gbs_api

tJRlDwAAQBAJ,Gothic Reflections,Peter Garrett,Literary Criticism,2018-08-06,Cornell University Press,,,249,"The Gothic has long been seen as offering a subversive challenge to the norms of realism. Locating both Gothic and mainstream Victorian fiction in a larger literary and cultural field, Peter K. Garrett argues that the oppositions usually posed between them are actually at work within both. He further shows how, by offering alternative versions of its stories, nineteenth-century Gothic fiction repeatedly reflects on narrative force, the power exerted by both writers and readers.Beginning with Poe's theory and practice of the Gothic tale as an exercise (or fantasy) of authorial power, Garrett then reads earlier eighteenth-century and Romantic Gothic fiction for comparable reflexive implications. Throughout, he stresses the ways authors doubled both characters and narrative perspectives to raise issues of power and authority in the tension between central deviant figures and social norms. Garrett then shows how the great nineteenth-century monster stories Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dracula self-consciously link the extremity and isolation of their deviant figures with the social groups they confront. These narratives, he argues, move from a Romantic concern with individual creation and responsibility to a Victorian affirmation of social solidarity that also reveals its dependence on the binding force of exclusionary violence. The final section of the book extends its investigation of Gothic reflections on narrative force into the more realistic social and psychological fiction of Dickens, Eliot, and James.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tJRlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=tJRlDwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=tJRlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=391&source=gbs_api

dEqRQgAACAAJ,The Girl,Ruth O. Saxton,Social Science,1998-08-15,Palgrave Macmillan,,,208,"The image of The Girl in contemporary fiction by women today stands in stark contrast to configurations of girlhood in earlier fiction. No longer banished to the realms of the Victorian ""marriage or death"" plots, girls in contemporary fiction embrace new challenges and freedoms while still struggling with plots centered on their bodies, societal limitations, and the price for freedom and escape. This unique collection tackles the contemporary forces at work on both the girls in fiction created by women and the writers themselves. The Girl investigates the legacies of expectation, competing cultural ideologies, and multiplicities of growing up female at the end of the 20th century as portrayed in contemporary fiction by women. The essayists show how new fictions of The Girl provide access to a constellation of themes and narrative patterns--including race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, class, female subjectivity, and nationalism--in new ways, while also continuing to envision girlhood in relation to such themes as love, separation from the mother, and maternal loss or overprotection. The first collection of critical essays to examine the portrayal of girls in contemporary women’s fiction within the context of recent sociological and psychological analyses of girls, The Girl proposes that contemporary stories of girlhood constitute a new lens for literary and cultural study. Examining the work of authors such as Toni Morrison, Jeanette Winterson, Jamaica Kincaid, and Joyce Carol Oates for their revelations and representations in regard to girlhood, these essays speak to, complement, and contest one another in a compelling interrogation of what it means to grow up female at the end of the millennium.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dEqRQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dEqRQgAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dEqRQgAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=404&source=gbs_api

YjuCDwAAQBAJ,Rapids,Tim Parks,Fiction,2011-11-07,Simon and Schuster,,,200,"A riveting white-water ride down a raging river in the Italian Alps, pitting people against Nature, in ""the novel Tim Parks was born to write"" (Sunday Telegraph, London). When 15 vacationers-six adults and nine adolescents-arrive in the Italian Alps to try their kayaking skills against the wild waters of the upper Aurino River, they have no idea what harrowing events await them. Among the group are the London banker Vince- recently widowed and trying to make sense of his life-and his teenage daughter Louise. Their hosts are Clive, an enigmatic but commanding leader, and his alluring but fragile girlfriend, Michela. Their lives intertwine over the next week in ways none could have foreseen, as they test their courage and varying abilities against the roaring waters, the rocks both seen and sunken, the endless treacherous logs, the flotsam and driftwood that become a liquid trap, as the threat of death accompanies them downstream. Rapids grippingly evokes the vertiginous thrill of entering a hostile environment, of being at the limit of control. Tim Parks's latest novel is alive with the drama of the water and the fragility of the people it bears along.

Wells was a genius and visionary, as demonstrated by many of his other works, but this book is clearly one of his best. He predicts nuclear warfare years before research began and describes the chain reactions involved and the resulting radiation. He describes a weapon of enormous destructive power, used from the air that would wipe out everything for miles, and actually used the term ""atomic bombs."" This book may have been at least part of the original inspiration for the development of atomic weapons, as well as presenting many other ideas that would ultimately come to pass.

It offers an introduction to the development of spy fiction both in England and in the United States and explores the ways in which issues such as the atomic bomb, double agents, paranoia, propaganda and megalomania manifest themselves within the genre. The book examines the ongoing marginalization of women within spy fiction texts, exploring the idea that this unique period in global history is responsible for the active promotion and celebration of masculinity and male superiority. From James Bond to Jason Bourne, the book evaluates the ongoing enforcement of patriarchal ideas and oppressions that, in the name of national security and patriotic duty, have contributed to the development of a genre in which discrimination and bias continue to dominate.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6qI6zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6qI6zwEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6qI6zwEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=426&source=gbs_api

rrOeg3_HdYwC,A Ready-Made Life,Chong-un Kim,Literary Criticism,1998-07-01,University of Hawaii Press,,,204,"A Ready Made Life is the first volume of early modern Korean fiction to appear in English in the U.S. Written between 1921 and 1943, the sixteen stories are an excellent introduction to the riches of modern Korean fiction. They reveal a variety of settings, voices, styles, and thematic concerns, and the best of them, masterpieces written mainly in the mid-1930s, display an impressive artistic maturity. Included among these authors are Hwang Sun-won, modern Korea's greatest short story writer; Kim Tong-in, regarded by many as the author who best captures the essence of the Korean identity; Ch'ae Man-shik, a master of irony; Yi Sang, a prominent modernist; Kim Yu-jong, whose stories are marked by a unique blend of earthy humor and compassion; Yi Kwang-su and Kim Tong-ni, modernizers of the language of twentieth-century Korean fiction; and Yi Ki-yúng, Yi T'ae-jun, and Pak T'ae-won, three writers who migrated to North Korea shortly after Liberation in 1945 and whose works were subsequently banned in South Korea until democratization in the late 1980s. One way of reading the stories, all of which were written during the Japanese occupation, is that beneath their often oppressive and gloomy surface lies an anticolonial subtext. They can also be read as a collective record of a people whose life choices were severely restricted, not just by colonization, but by education (either too little or too much, as the title story shows) and by a highly structured society that had little tolerance for those who overstepped its boundaries. Life was unremittingly onerous for many Koreans during this period, whatever their social background. In the stories, educated city folk fare little better than farmers and laborers. A Ready-Made Life will provide scholars and students with crucial access to the literature of Korea's colonial period. A generous opening essay discusses the collection in the context of modern Korean literary history, and short introductions precede each story. Here is a richly diverse testament to a modern literature that is poised to assume a long overdue place in world literature.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rrOeg3_HdYwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rrOeg3_HdYwC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rrOeg3_HdYwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=432&source=gbs_api

PBLjuTl81JEC,Whose Life is it Anyway?,Sinéad Moriarty,Fiction,2009-04-16,Penguin UK,,,374,"Also published under the title Keeping It In the Family. In her fifth novel, Whose Life Is It Anyway?, Sinéad Moriarty has done it again: taken a complex topic - what happens when a young woman falls in love with someone dramatically different than the kind of man her family would have expected - and created an insightful, gripping and moving story filled with delightfully sparky characters, plenty of straight-talking, and all her trademark fun and humour. In balancing of light and shade, pathos and comedy, Sinéad manages to pull off a unique feat - a story that combines the provocative qualities of a Jodi Picoult story with the warmth and humour of Marian Keyes. It's tricky for Niamh O'Flaherty, growing up in a North London home that's a shrine to all things Irish. But it's even trickier being an adult and realizing that her family expects her to settle down with a nice Irish lad, especially now that she's living in Dublin. When Niamh finally meets the love of her life he is the last person she would expect to fall for her. Pierre is older and an intellectual, but she loves his ability to laugh at himself, his calmness and strength of character, and, of course, his stunning looks. There's just one problem: if Pierre's parents - Jean and Fleur - are sniffy about their pride and joy hooking up with a girl who writes a fluffy newspaper column, her parents, Mick and Annie, are going to go ballistic when they hear that their daughter intends to marry someone who couldn't be less Irish if he tried . . . Sinéad Moriarty's novels have sold over half a million copies in Ireland and the UK and she is a four times nominee for the popular fiction Irish Book Award. She has won over readers and critics telling stories that are funny, humane, moving and relevant to modern women. Whose Life Is It Anyway? is Sinéad at her very best. Sinéad Moriarty lives with her family in Dublin. Her other titles are: The Baby Trail; A Perfect Match; From Here to Maternity; In My Sister's Shoes; Pieces of My Heart; Me and My Sisters and This Child of Mine.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PBLjuTl81JEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PBLjuTl81JEC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PBLjuTl81JEC&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=441&source=gbs_api

Wilbur",Uncategorized,2015-11-28,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,,78,"Jules Gabriel Verne (1828 -1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. Verne was born to bourgeois parents in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages Extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. The pioneering submarine designer Simon Lake credited his inspiration to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and his autobiography begins ""Jules Verne was in a sense the director-general of my life."" William Beebe, Sir Ernest Shackleton, and Robert Ballard found similar early inspiration in the novel, and Jacques Cousteau called it his ""shipboard bible."" The aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont named Verne as his favorite author and the inspiration for his own elaborate flying machines. Igor Sikorsky often quoted Verne and cited his Robur the Conqueror as the inspiration for his invention of the first successful helicopter. The rocketry innovators Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth are all known to have taken their inspiration from Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, the astronauts on the Apollo 8 mission, were similarly inspired, with Borman commenting ""In a very real sense, Jules Verne is one of the pioneers of the space age."" When cosmonaut Georgi Grechko was orbiting Earth with Yuri Romanenko on the Salyut 6 in 1978, he broadcast back a message to celebrate Verne's 150th birthday, saying: ""There's hardly a person who hasn't read his books, at any rate not among the cosmonauts, because Jules Verne was a dreamer, a visionary who saw flights in space. I'd say this flight too was predicted by Jules Verne.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IVD0jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IVD0jwEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IVD0jwEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=463&source=gbs_api

pKhoswEACAAJ,The Invisible Man,H. G. Wells,Uncategorized,2017-10-03,,,,98,"THE INVISIBLE MANThe Invisible Man is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse it.While its predecessors, The Time Machine and The Island of Doctor Moreau, were written using first-person narrators, Wells adopts a third-person objective point of view in The Invisible Man.A mysterious man, Griffin, arrives at the local inn of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. The stranger wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; his face is hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose; and he wears a wide-brimmed hat. He is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. He demands to be left alone and spends most of his time in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. While Griffin is staying at the inn, hundreds of strange glass bottles (that he calls his luggage) arrive. Many local townspeople believe this to be very strange. He becomes the talk of the village with many theorizing as to his origins.H. G. WellsHerbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946), usually referred to as H. G. Wells, was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is called a ""father of science fiction"", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. Wells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwiniancontext. He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist. Novels like Kipps and The History of Mr Polly, which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. A diabetic, in 1934, Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as Diabetes UK).Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 46 High Street in Bromley, Kent, on 21 September 1866. Called ""Bertie"" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former domestic servant).",,http://books.google.com/books?id=pKhoswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pKhoswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&cd=477&source=gbs_api

In 1917 Siegfried Sasson, noted poet and decorated war hero, publicly refused to continue serving as a British officer in World War I. His reason: the war was a senseless slaughter. He was officially classified ""mentally unsound"" and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital. There a brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. William Rivers, set about restoring Sassoon’s “sanity” and sending him back to the trenches. This novel tells what happened as only a novel can. It is a war saga in which not a shot is fired. It is a story of a battle for a man's mind in which only the reader can decide who is the victor, who the vanquished, and who the victim.

The book explores the role of the palace as home to the heir to the throne before 1714, its impact on the development of London and the West end during the late Stuart period, and how, following the fire at the palace of Whitehall, St James's became the principal seat of the British monarchy in 1698. The arrangement and display of the paintings and furnishings making up the Royal Collection at St James's is chronicled as the book follows the fortunes of the palace through the Victorian and Edwardian periods up to the present day. Specially commissioned maps, phased plans, and digital reconstructions of the palace at key moments in its development accompany a rich array of historical drawings, watercolors, photographs, and plans.

The book represents the modern, progressive spirit which fits that time, in its forms of expression and its editorship. The purpose of this work is to answer the why, who, what, when, where, how of the wide majority of curious minds, both young and adult, and encourage them to raise further questions. Special measures were taken in creating this work to isolate essentials from non-essentials; to differentiate human interest subjects of universal significance from those of little concern; to deliver living truths instead of dead vocabulary; and finally, to bring the whole within the knowledge of the intermediate reader, without regard to age, in an acceptable and exciting form. The use of visual outlines and tables; maps, drawings, and diagrams; the illustrated works of great painters, sculptors, and architects all are used to give the reader the valuable and cultural knowledge of past and present.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dBF0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dBF0EAAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dBF0EAAAQBAJ&pg=PR2&dq=history&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api

YsWAEAAAQBAJ,Our Reason for Being,T. F. Leong,Religion,2022-08-11,Wipf and Stock Publishers,,,267,Ecclesiastes is a persuasive speech with a rhetoric so unique that it can be easily misunderstood. It speaks powerfully to believers as well as nonbelievers because it addresses the question of the meaning of life in the most satisfying way. The heart of this book is an expositional commentary that interprets Ecclesiastes as authoritative Scripture. It seeks to recover the rhetoric of the speech in terms of its comprehensive message on the meaning of life as well as its compelling force to get the message across. Preceding the expositional commentary is an introduction to Ecclesiastes that presents a new approach to outlining and reading Ecclesiastes as a coherent speech. It also presents an overview of the “forest”—the overall rhetorical flow of the speech from beginning to end. This is to prevent one from getting lost when immersed in the “trees” of the expositional commentary. Following the expositional commentary are two topical studies to give Ecclesiastes the breadth and depth of coverage it deserves. The first is an interdisciplinary exposition on the meaning of life. The second is an interpretive essay to defend exegetically the interpretation of Ecclesiastes as a coherent speech.,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YsWAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YsWAEAAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YsWAEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA199&dq=history&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api

FWaXEAAAQBAJ,Critical Legal Education as a Subversive Activity,"Helen Gibbon, Ben Golder, Lucas Lixinski, Marina Nehme, Prue Vines",Law,2015-10-16,Taylor & Francis,,,250,"In an age when everyone aspires to teach critical thinking skills in the classroom, what does it mean to be a subversive law teacher? Who or what might a subversive law teacher seek to subvert – the authority of the law, the university, their own authority as teachers, perhaps? Are law students ripe for subversion, agents of, or impediments to, subversion? Do they learn to ask critical questions? Responding to the provocation in the classic book Teaching as a Subversive Activity, by Postman and Weingartner, the idea that teaching could, or even should, be subversive still holds true today, and its premise is particularly relevant in the context of legal education. We therefore draw on this classic book to discuss, in the present volume, the consideration of research into legal education as lifetime learning, as creating meaning, as transformative and as developing world-changing thinking within the legal context. The volume offers research into classroom experiences and theoretical and historical interrogations of what it means to teach law subversively. Primarily aimed at legal educators and doctoral students in law planning careers as academics, its insights speak directly to tensions in higher education more broadly.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FWaXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FWaXEAAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FWaXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT171&dq=history&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api

Its subject is the fate of one of the world's greatest civilizations over thirteen centuries - its rulers, wars and society, and the events that led to its disastrous collapse. Here, in volumes three and four, Gibbon vividly recounts the waves of barbarian invaders under commanders such as Alaric and Attila, who overran and eventually destroyed the West. He then turns his gaze to events in the East, where even the achievements of the Byzantine emperor Justinian and the campaigns of the brilliant military leader Belisarius could not conceal the fundamental weaknesses of their empire.

aSL7kHUhCHwC,"Theatre History Studies 2014, Vol. 33",Elizabeth Reitz Mullenix,Performing Arts,2014-12-15,University Alabama Press,,,324,"Volume 33 of Theatre History Studies explores war. War is a paradox—horrifying and compelling, galvanizing and devastating, a phenomenon that separates and decimates while at the same time creating and strengthening national identity and community bonds. War is the stuff of great drama. War and theatre is a subject of increasing popularity among scholars of theatre. The essays in this special edition of Theatre History Studies brings together a unique collection of work by thirteen innovative scholars whose work explores such topics as theatre performances during war times, theatre written and performed to resist war, and theatre that fosters and promotes war. The contributors to this volume write poignantly about nationhood and about how war—through both propaganda and protest—defines a people. The contributors also delve into numerous fascinating themes that transcend time, peoples, nations, and particular conflicts: the foundations of nationalism and the concepts of occupied and occupier, nostalgia and utopia, and patriotism and revolution. These essays survey a march of civil and international wars spanning three centuries. Arranged chronologically, they invite comparisons between themes and trace the development of the major themes of war. Ideas manifest in the theatre of one period recall ideologies and propaganda of the past, reflect those of the present, and anticipate wars to come.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aSL7kHUhCHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aSL7kHUhCHwC&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aSL7kHUhCHwC&q=history&dq=history&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api

MlXlEAAAQBAJ,"""The Gunny Sack"" by M. G. Vassanji. A review of the most important topics",Unknown,History,2023-11-24,GRIN Verlag,,,14,"Essay from the year 2022 in the subject African Studies - Literature, grade: 13, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Anglistik), course: An Introducton to African Diasporic Literature in English: Mobility, Migration, and Cultural Shifts, language: English, abstract: After a short Summary, this paper deals with the themes of travelling memory and history; diaspora, displacement & diasporic imagination; cross-cultural encounters; role of the woman/gender role; and travel and mobility. Each topic has been written in the form of an essay and works closely with the novel ""The Gunny Sack"", i.e. the individual examples per topic are supported by text excerpts. Excerpt from an essay that deals with the topic of ""Traveling Memory and History"": In his novel ""The Gunny Sack"", M.G. Vassanji depicts the family history of Salim, whose family is in constant movement as they move from one place to another, constantly accompanied by historical events. This essay seeks to investigate the theme of travel-memory and history through a series of examples. The novel focuses on the impact of history and how history affects the present. In ""The Gunny Sack"", the narrator Salim Juma unpacks his family history, and thus he uncovers the past with all its attendant features. Be it the political history of East Africa or the riddles of memories. [...] It can thus be assumed that family history serves as an extension of political history. Furthermore, memory as a narrative device also builds a bridge between the past, present and future, as Salim emphasizes that history must not repeat itself and fervently hopes that he will be the last migrant from his family. [...] However, the past, which is largely in the gunny sack, should never be forgotten. In addition, Vassanji tends to preserve collective memory and present it through the experiences of individuals. The gunny sack contains many mementos, each of which tells a chapter of his family's history. ""The Gunny Sack"" is both a story about the arrival and life of an extended family in East Africa and a repository for the collective memory and life stories of many other Asian-Africans.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MlXlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=MlXlEAAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=MlXlEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP6&dq=history&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api

Davies is a sweeping chronicle of human history, encompassing the grand narrative from the ancient world to the cusp of the 20th century. Originally published in 1928, Davies' tome remains an impressive feat of historical synthesis, offering a concise and objective overview of the major events, empires, cultures, and figures that have shaped our world. The book unfolds chronologically, taking readers on a captivating journey through the rise and fall of civilizations, the ebb and flow of political power, and the transformative forces of social and cultural evolution. From the majestic pyramids of Egypt to the bustling marketplaces of medieval China, Davies paints a vivid picture of the tapestry of human experience across continents and millennia.

He avoids getting bogged down in excessive details, instead opting for a clear and concise presentation of the most significant historical developments. This makes An Outline History of the World an ideal starting point for anyone seeking a comprehensive understanding of the past, whether they are seasoned history buffs or curious newcomers.

mRNSDwAAQBAJ,Geopolitics. A historical review,Jean Cédric Obame Emane,Political Science,2018-03-19,GRIN Verlag,,,35,"Essay from the year 2016 in the subject Politics - Basics and General, grade: A, ( Atlantic International University ), course: Geopolitics, language: English, abstract: To begin with, we would like to highlight that doing research on geopolitics has brought us to go deeper into a certain literature that enabled us to understand from the very beginning what geopolitics was meant for. The literature we have used consists of two categories, books relative to the latest changes on the discipline; we mean geopolitics in the present. The other literature is concerned with books of the 1990s with some authors like Ó Tuathail, Dalby and others, books that give a historical perspective of geopolitics. Furthermore, we believe that for a discipline like geopolitics that we have never studied in our previous university studies, we did not just need to make a good assignment and that is all, but also to acquire tools that might help us to be knowledgeable in that coursework. For this reason, we needed to read books that analyze and explain what the essence of geopolitics is. Our basic thesis statement is that the geographical conditions of a country, this is to say that its endowment in natural resources can have an impact on its geopolitical orientation, which is its foreign policy. In other words, geographical conditions influence a country’s foreign policy or attitude in international affairs. This we will provide an example with Gabon, our home country.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mRNSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mRNSDwAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mRNSDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=history&hl=&cd=205&source=gbs_api

Together with Dan Evans and Joel Pritchard, he was a key player in generating a new wave of progressive Republican politics in Washington State. He helped elect the youngest governor in state history; argued 14 cases bafore the U.S. Supreme Court as attorney general; upset a legend to win a seat in the U.S. Senate; saved baseball for Seattle; angered Indians and environmentalists; championed the plight of timber towns caught in the crossfire over the spotted owl; suffered a bitter defeat and made a comback, only to lose one of the closest Senate races in American history. Gorton went on to investigate British Petroleum's safety practices, forged consensus on the 9/11 Commission and served on the 2011 Redistricting Commission. This sweeping biography explores the eventful life of a resilient politican who remains in the arena in his 80s.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pidcm1yCKc4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pidcm1yCKc4C&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pidcm1yCKc4C&q=history&dq=history&hl=&cd=210&source=gbs_api

As the bicentennial of the framing of our Constitution approaches, here we provide monumental evidence that our nation has not forgotten the chief architect and advocate of our still-vital Constitution. Historians will probably agree that James Madison was less effective as a politician than as a statesman, a scholar, and a political philosopher. If the politician must have his eye on the next election, and the statesman on the next generation, this Library, invigorated by the quiet scholarly spirit of Madison, can remind us of the vistas of the past, and future, generations. - Foreword.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mgy5B-tM8j4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mgy5B-tM8j4C&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mgy5B-tM8j4C&q=history&dq=history&hl=&cd=225&source=gbs_api

KgTZGznktIgC,Pop Art,Steven Henry Madoff,Art,1997-11-15,University of California Press,,,452,"Pop Art: A Critical History chronicles one of the most controversial art movements of the century. The anthology draws from a great range of sources, from the leading art magazines and art historical journals to newspapers and news magazines such as the New York Times, Life, and Newsweek. What emerges from this rich cross-section of critical and journalistic commentary is a fascinating view of the tumultuous rise of Pop art and its establishment as a major force in contemporary art. A broad selection of articles traces the emergence of the movement itself in England and America, as seen through the eyes of the working critics of the day. The focus then narrows to present in-depth writings on the four major Pop artists: Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol, along with an examination of many other artists involved in the movement. From reviews of the very first shows of many of these artists to interviews with them, to news stories about their collectors and their lifestyles, Pop Art: A Critical History represents the most complete and coherent record of Pop art yet published. The book concludes with an invaluable chronology of the major '60s exhibitions by Pop artists. Among the contributors are Lawrence Alloway, John Coplans, Donald Judd, Max Kozloff, Gerald Nordland, Peter Plagens, Barbara Rose, Robert Rosenblum, John Russell, Gene Swenson, and Sidney Tillim.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KgTZGznktIgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KgTZGznktIgC&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KgTZGznktIgC&dq=history&hl=&cd=264&source=gbs_api

uqAGCD2V8yQC,Mothers of All Children,Elizabeth Jane Clapp,Biography & Autobiography,1998,Penn State University Press,,,232,"A history of the juvenile court movement in America, which focuses upon the central but neglected contribution of women reformers.The establishment of juvenile courts in cities across the United States was one of the earliest social welfare reforms of the Progressive Era. The first juvenile court law was passed in Illinois in 1899. Within a decade twenty-two other states had passed similar laws, based on the Illinois example. Mothers of All Children examines this movement, focusing especially on the role of women reformers and the importance of gender consciousness in influencing the shape of reform. Until recently historians have assumed that male reformers dominated many of the Progressive Era social reforms. Mothers of All Children goes beyond simply writing women back into the history of the juvenile court movement to reveal the complexity of their involvement. Some women operated within nineteenth-century ideals of motherhood and domesticity while others, trained in the social sciences and living in,the poor neighborhoods of America's cities, took a more pragmatic approach.Despite these differences, Clapp finds a common maternalist approach that distinguished women reformers from their male counterparts. Women were more willing to use the state to deal with wayward children, whereas men were more commonly involved as supporters of women reformers' initiatives rather than being themselves the initiators of reform.Firmly located in the context of recent scholarship on American women's history, Mothers of All Children has broad implications for American women's political history and the history of the welfare state.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uqAGCD2V8yQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uqAGCD2V8yQC&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uqAGCD2V8yQC&q=history&dq=history&hl=&cd=272&source=gbs_api

uPzKswEACAAJ,The New History,Alun Munslow,Uncategorized,2017-05-03,Routledge,,,244,"The notion of 'history' has always been one strenuously debated by both academics and the wider population. This deeply provocative re-thinking of our engagement with the past by one of the world's leading post-modern historians takes that debate one step further. Alun Munslow re-assesses history in the light of post-modernism and other intellectual challenges which have questioned the primacy of the modernist epistemology of empiricism. In an original and stimulating vision of history that will intrigue all those seriously interested in the subject, Munslow argues that history is not only about the sources, but a literary construction. Munslow concludes that history, as a cultural narrative about the past can never tell us what the past really means. This far reaching conclusion is based on the radical idea that the content of history is defined as much by the nature of the language used to represent and interpret that content as it is by research into the sources. This suggests that history does not produce the most likely meaning of the past but rather can only generate alternative meanings. The lead volume in a major new series on historical thinking and practice, this is an accessible yet absorbing study that breaks new ground in discussing the stage history is at now, and perhaps most engagingly, the direction it will take in the future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uPzKswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uPzKswEACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uPzKswEACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&cd=291&source=gbs_api

Pg-ErgEACAAJ,The Matter of History,Timothy J. LeCain,History,2017-07-31,Cambridge University Press,,,358,"New insights into the microbiome, epigenetics, and cognition are radically challenging our very idea of what it means to be 'human', while an explosion of neo-materialist thinking in the humanities has fostered a renewed appreciation of the formative powers of a dynamic material environment. The Matter of History brings these scientific and humanistic ideas together to develop a bold, new post-anthropocentric understanding of the past, one that reveals how powerful organisms and things help to create humans in all their dimensions, biological, social, and cultural. Timothy J. LeCain combines cutting-edge theory and detailed empirical analysis to explain the extraordinary late-nineteenth century convergence between the United States and Japan at the pivotal moment when both were emerging as global superpowers. Illustrating the power of a deeply material social and cultural history, The Matter of History argues that three powerful things - cattle, silkworms, and copper - helped to drive these previously diverse nations towards a global 'Great Convergence'.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pg-ErgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Pg-ErgEACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Pg-ErgEACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&cd=337&source=gbs_api

GAiAswEACAAJ,The History and Literature of the Crusades (Classic Reprint),Heinrich Von Sybel,History,2017-05-27,Forgotten Books,,,380,"Excerpt from The History and Literature of the Crusades The first part of the work now submitted to the public, is a translation of the lectures delivered at Munich; the second part is taken from the preface to his History of the First Crusade, published in 1841 and consists of an elaborate criticism on the various original authorities in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and on the later historians of the Crusades, down to the present time. There exists, we believe, no such critical examination of the ori ginal authorities in any other language. The refer ences to them in Mills's History of the Crusades are somewhat meagre; while\ Michaud, although in his Bibliotheque des Croisades he has given ample extracts, has nowhere subjected the originals to the rigorous and minute analysis they undergo at the hands of the German Professor. The first impulse to a critical examination of the original authorities of the First Crusade was given by Professor Ranke in his Historical Exercises He began with the first books of William of Tyre, which he proved to be merely a repetition of earlier accounts by Albert of Aix, Ray mond of Agiles, and from the 'gesta Francorum.' He then examined Albert of Aix, whose work he considered to be derived chieﬂy from oral tradition. Professor Ranke's other avocations prevented his pursuing this subject any further; but sufficient was done to clear the way for other historical stu dents; and v. Sybel has carried out the method of his eminent teacher. The narrative of the First Crusade, as given by Mills and other modern historians, v. Sybel re gards as a mingled mass of truth and falsehood, of history and legend, founded chieﬂy on the account of William of Tyre. William of Tyre wrote in 1170, and with much that was valuable, he mixed tales borrowed from Albert of Aix The general character of the work is thought by the German Professor to be poetical and legendary.

zgIGVWo_2FkC,"History, Medicine, and the Traditions of Renaissance Learning",Nancy G. Siraisi,History,2007-11-05,University of Michigan Press,,,468,"A major, path-breaking work, History, Medicine, and the Traditions of Renaissance Learning is Nancy G. Siraisi's examination into the intersections of medically trained authors and history in the period 1450 to 1650. Rather than studying medicine and history as separate disciplinary traditions, Siraisi calls attention to their mutual interaction in the rapidly changing world of Renaissance erudition. Far from their contributions being a mere footnote in the historical record, medical writers had extensive involvement in the reading, production, and shaping of historical knowledge during this important period. With remarkably detailed scholarship, Siraisi investigates doctors' efforts to explore the legacies handed down to them from ancient medical and anatomical writings and the difficult reconciliations this required between the authority of the ancient world and the discoveries of the modern. She also studies the ways in which sixteenth-century medical authors wrote history, both in their own medical texts and in more general historical works. In the course of her study, Siraisi finds that what allowed medical writers to become so fully engaged in the writing of history was their general humanistic background, their experience of history through the field of medicine's past, and the tools that the writing of history offered to the development of a rapidly evolving profession. Nancy G. Siraisi is one of the preeminent scholars of medieval and Renaissance intellectual history, specializing in medicine and science. Now Distinguished Professor Emerita of History at Hunter College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and a 2008 winner of a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, she has written numerous books, includingTaddeo Alderotti and His Pupils(Princeton, 1981), which won the American Association for the History of Medicine William H. Welch Medal;Avicenna in Renaissance Italy(Princeton, 1987);The Clock and the Mirror(Princeton, 1997); and the widely used textbookMedieval and Early Renaissance Medicine(Chicago, 1990), which won the Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize from the History of Science Society. In 2003 Siraisi received the History of Science Society's George Sarton Medal, in 2004 she received the Paul Oskar Kristellar Award for Lifetime Achievement of the Renaissance Society of America, and in 2005 she was awarded the American Historical Association Award for Scholarly Distinction. ""A fascinating study of Renaissance physicians as avid readers and enthusiastic writers of all kinds of history: from case narratives and medical biographies to archaeological and environmental histories. In this wide-ranging book, Nancy Siraisi demonstrates the deep links between the medical and the humanistic disciplines in early modern Europe."" ---Katharine Park, Zemurray Stone Radcliffe Professor of the History of Science, Harvard University ""This is a salient but little explored aspect of Renaissance humanism, and there is no doubt that Siraisi has succeeded in throwing light onto a vast subject. The scholarship is wide-ranging and profound, and breaks new ground. The choice of examples is fascinating, and it puts Renaissance documents into a new context. This is a major book, well written, richly learned and with further implications for more than students of medical history."" ---Vivian Nutton, Professor, The Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine, University College London, and author ofFrom Democedes to Harvey: Studies in the History of Medicine ""Siraisi shows the many-dimensioned overlaps and interactions between medicine and 'history' in the early modern period, marking a pioneering effort to survey a neglected discipline. Her book follows the changing usage of the classical term 'history' both as empiricism and as a kind of scholarship in the Renaissance before its more modern analytical and critical applications. It is a marvel of erudition in an area insufficiently studied."" ---Donald R.

wCVlrgEACAAJ,"History, Ethics, and the Recognition of the Other",Anton Froeyman,Applied ethics,2016,,,,0,"This book introduces a new way of looking at the writing of history. Rather than as the production of knowledge or the telling of stories, it sees writing history as an ethical, existential and emotional engagement with the people from the past. The conceptual and philosophical basis for this view is provided by the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. In the first part, the view is presented and contrasted with other, competing views, such as those of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Michel Foucault. In the second part, the view is argued for, most importantly by an in-depth discussion of one specific tradition of history-writing (microhistory), and a series of close readings of several classical works from the history of historiography. The third part, finally, explores some of the methodological consequences of this view, and applies it to a non-academic way of dealing with the past, namely historical performance practice in music.

But today's conflict is only the latest in a long history of battles over Ukraine's existence as a sovereign nation. As award-winning historian Serhii Plokhy argues in The Gates of Europe, we must examine Ukraine's past in order to understand its fraught present and likely future. Situated between Europe, Russia, and the Asian East, Ukraine was shaped by the empires that have used it as a strategic gateway between East and West—from the Romans and Ottomans to the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, all have engaged in global fights for supremacy on Ukrainian soil. Each invading army left a lasting mark on the landscape and on the population, making modern Ukraine an amalgam of competing cultures.

The civilizational patterns that grew out of this exceptionally creative phase are a particularly rewarding theme for comparative analysis. The book contains essays on cultural transformations in Ancient Greece, Ancient Israel, Iran, India and China, as well as background developments in the core civilizations of the Ancient Near East. An introductory section deals with the history of the debate on the AxialAge, the theoretical questions that have emerged from it, and the present state of the discussion. The book will be useful for comparative historians of cultures and religions, as well as for historical sociologists interested in the comparative analysis of civilizations. It should also help linking the fields of classical, biblical and Asian studies to broader interdisciplinary debates within the humanities sciences. Contributors include: Johann P.

But for the past seven decades, our understanding of it has relied upon conventional wisdom, propaganda and an interpretation skewed by the information available.

In Germany Ascendant, the first part of this ground-breaking new history, James Holland introduces the war, beginning with the lead-up to its outbreak in 1939 and taking us up to mid-1941 as the Nazis prepared to unleash Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia. To tell the real story, he weaves together the experiences of dozens of individuals, from civilians and soldiers, to sailors, pilots, leading military strategists, industrialists and heads of state, and uncovers the strategy, tactics and events that informed not only the military aspects of the war but also the economic, political, and social aspects too.

We are living longer, healthier, and better lives than anyone who has gone before. And this is the result of a whole chain of people who have invented or discovered something that has changed our world. Where would we be without inventors, philosophers, economists, politicians, explorers, and other ""ideas"" people? Some of our historical heroes were lone geniuses but many were influenced by other great thinkers and ideas. There would be no Facebook without the internet-and no internet with computers. And there could be no computers without the great mathematicians and philosophers of ancient times. So who's the Genius-Mark Zuckerberg, or Pythagoras? We think it's both. This is why every spread features a panel called ""They couldn't have done it without..."", revealing the people who made earlier contributions to the cause. With chapters on medicine and food processes, entertainment and culture, there's something in 100 People Who Made History for everyone. Full of true-life stories and famous celebs, 100 People proves that history can be exciting and relevant. So let's hear it for the heroes from throughout the ages: those who save lives, those who improve lives, and those who make our lives just that bit more enjoyable.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q7fdH4gusd4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7fdH4gusd4C&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7fdH4gusd4C&dq=history&hl=&cd=422&source=gbs_api

More at LargePrintLiberty.com This is the 1908 book that started it all in the 20th century, the book that kicked off a century of anti-state, pro-property writing. This was the prototype for Nock's writing, for Chodorov's work, and even the theoretical edifice that later became Rothbardianism.Indeed, Franz Oppenheimer wrote what remains one of the most bracing and stimulating volumes in the history of political philosophy. The author sought to overthrow centuries of fallacious thinking on the subject of the state's origin, nature, and purpose, put its it place a view of the state that constitutes a foundational attack on the structure of modern society.He utterly demolishes the social-contract view of the state as it had been advanced by most thinkers since the Enlightenment. He seeks to replace that view with a realistic assessment of the state, one that can only make anyone with statist leanings squirm: he sees the state as composed of a victorious group of bandits who rule over the defeated group with the purpose of domination and exploitation. It achieves its status through a form of conquest, secures its power through relentless aggression, and sees its main function is to secure its status and power.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YsIpAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YsIpAAAAYAAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YsIpAAAAYAAJ&dq=history&hl=&cd=426&source=gbs_api

One phenomenon is the presence and influence of the same presuppositions or other operative ""ideas"" in very diverse provinces of thought and in different periods. Another is the role of semantic transitions and confusions, of shifts and of ambiguities in the meanings of terms, in the history of thought and taste. A third phenomenon is the internal tensions or waverings in the mind of almost every individual writer—sometimes discernible even in a single writing or on a single page—arising from conflicting ideas or incongruous propensities of feeling or taste to which the writer is susceptible. These essays do not contribute to metaphysical and epistemological questions; they are primarily historical.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_2kgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_2kgAAAAMAAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_2kgAAAAMAAJ&q=history&dq=history&hl=&cd=455&source=gbs_api

nsA1GwAACAAJ,The Battle,Alessandro Barbero,History,2005-07-20,Walker,,,400,"A vivid human and military history of the legendary battle At Waterloo, some 70,000 men under Napoleon and an equal number under Wellington faced one another in a titanic and bloody struggle. In the end, as John Keegan notes, contemporaries felt that Napoleon's defeat had ""reversed the tide of European history."" Even 190 years later, the name Waterloo resounds. Italian historian Alessandro Barbero's majestic new account stands apart from previous British and French histories by giving voice to all the nationalities that took part. Invoking the memories of British, French, and Prussian soldiers, Barbero meticulously re-creates the conflict as it unfolded, from General Reille's early afternoon assault on the chateau of Hougoumont, to the desperate last charge of Napoleon's Imperial Guard as evening settled in. From privates to generals, Barbero recounts individual miracles and tragedies, moments of courage and foolhardiness, skillfully blending them into the larger narrative of the battle's extraordinary ebb and flow. One is left with indelible images: cavalry charges against soldiers formed in squares; the hand-to-hand combat around farmhouses; endless cannon balls and smoke. And, finally, a powerful appreciation of the inevitability and futility of war. To be published on the 190th anniversary of Waterloo, The Battle is a masterpiece of military history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nsA1GwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nsA1GwAACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nsA1GwAACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&cd=459&source=gbs_api

Analyzing the narratives that emerge from these sources as products of Song political discourse, Hartman offers a thorough introduction to the texts and the political circumstances surrounding their compilation. Distilling from these sources a 'grand allegory of Song history', he argues that the narratives embedded within reflect tension between a Confucian model of political institutionalism and the Song court's preference for a non-sectarian, technocratic model. Fundamentally rethinking the corpus of texts that have formed the basis of our understanding of the Song and of imperial China more broadly, this far-reaching account of historiographical process and knowledge production illuminates the relationship between official history writing and political struggle in China.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=POpEzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=POpEzwEACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=POpEzwEACAAJ&dq=history&hl=&cd=461&source=gbs_api

g63qBgAAQBAJ,The Third Reich in History and Memory,Richard J. Evans,History,2015-02-20,Oxford University Press,,,496,"In the seventy years since the demise of the Third Reich, there has been a significant transformation in the ways in which the modern world understands Nazism. In this brilliant and eye-opening collection, Richard J. Evans, the acclaimed author of the Third Reich trilogy, offers a critical commentary on that transformation, exploring how major changes in perspective have informed research and writing on the Third Reich in recent years. Drawing on his most notable writings from the last two decades, Evans reveals the shifting perspectives on Nazism's rise to political power, its economic intricacies, and its subterranean extension into postwar Germany. Evans considers how the Third Reich is increasingly viewed in a broader international context, as part of the age of imperialism; discusses the growing emphasis on the larger economic and cultural circumstances of the era; and emphasizes the development of research into Nazi society, particularly in the understanding of Nazi Germany as a political system based on popular approval and consent. Exploring the complex relationship between memory and history, Evans also points out the places where the growing need to confront the misdeeds of Nazism and expose the complicity of those who participated has led to crude and sweeping condemnation, when instead historians should be making careful distinctions. Written with Evans' sharp-eyed insight and characteristically compelling style, these essays offer a summation of the collective cultural memory of Nazism in the present, and suggest the degree to which memory must be subjected to the close scrutiny of history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g63qBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=g63qBgAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=g63qBgAAQBAJ&dq=history&hl=&cd=472&source=gbs_api

D5U5AAAAMAAJ,The Rise of Scientific Philosophy,Hans Reichenbach,Philosophy,1951,Univ of California Press,5,1,360,"This book represents a new approach to philosophy. It treats philosophy as not a collection of systems, but as a study of problems. It recognizes in traditional philosophical systems the historical function of having asked questions rather than having given solutions. Professor Reichenbach traces the failures of the systems to psychological causes. Speculative philosophers offered answers at a time when science had not yet provided the means to give true answers. Their search for certainty and for moral directives led them to accept pseudo-solutions. Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and many others are cited to illustrate the rationalist fallacy: reason, unaided by observation, was regarded as a source of knowledge, revealing the physical world and ""moral truth."" The empiricists could not disprove this thesis, for they could not give a valid account of mathematical knowledge. Mathematical discoveries in the early nineteenth century cleared the way for modern scientific philosophy. Its advance was furthered by discoveries in modern physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. These findings have made possible a new conception of the universe and of the atom. The work of scientists thus altered philosophy completely and brought into being a philosopher with a new attitude and training. Instead of dictating so-called laws of reason to the scientist, this modern philosopher proceeds by analyzing scientific methods and results. He finds answers to the age-old questions of space, time, causality, and life; of the human observer and the external world. He tells us how to find our way through this world without resorting to unjustifiable beliefs or assuming a supernatural origin for moral standards. Philosophy thus is no longer a battleground of contradictory opinions, but a science discovering truth step by step. Professor Reichenbach, known for his many contributions to logic and the philosophy of science, addresses this book to a wider audience. He writes for those who do not have the leisure or preparation to read in the fields of mathematics, symbolic logic, or physics. Besides showing the principal foundations of the new philosophy, he has been careful to provide the necessary factual background. He has written a philosophical study, not a mere popularization. It contains within its chapters all the necessary scientific material in an understandable form—and, therefore, conveys all the information indispensable to a modern world-view. The late Hans Reichenbach was Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles.

This volume comprises a lecture course given at the University of Freiburg in 1932, five years after the publication of Being and Time. During this period, Heidegger was at the height of his creative powers, which are on full display in this clear and imaginative text. Heidegger analyses two of the earliest philosophical source documents, fragments by Greek thinkers Anaximander and Parmenides. Heidegger develops their common theme of Being and non-being and shows that the question of Being is indeed the origin of Western philosophy. His engagement with these Greek texts is as much of a return to beginnings as it is a potential reawakening of philosophical wonder and inquiry in the present.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2i8aBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2i8aBgAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2i8aBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api

Ernst Cassirer here examines the changes brewing in the early stages of the Renaissance, tracing the interdependence of philosophy, language, art, and science; the newfound recognition of individual consciousness; and the great thinkers of the period—from da Vinci and Galileo to Pico della Mirandola and Giordano Bruno. The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy discusses the importance of fifteenth-century philosopher Nicholas Cusanus, the concepts of freedom and necessity, and the subject-object problem in Renaissance thought. “This fluent translation of a scholarly and penetrating original leaves little impression of an attempt to show that a ‘spirit of the age’ or ‘spiritual essence of the time’ unifies and expresses itself in all aspects of society or culture.”—Philosophy",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bNCvyLxEAXgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bNCvyLxEAXgC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bNCvyLxEAXgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api
VGlEIioFaGoC,The Metaphysics of Self and World,Elie Maynard Adams,Philosophy,1991,Temple University Press,,,352,"A great fissure occurred in Western civilization in the early modern period with the divorce between the humanities and the sciences and the rise of scientific naturalism. The Metaphysics of Self and World is a philosophical exploration of the relationship between the individual, the culture, and the world. It is, in the author's words, ""a philosophy of the humanities, a philosophy of humanity, and a philosophy of social reality."" It explores the implications of a world-view that would integrate the perspective of the sciences with humanistic ways of thought. E.M. Adams claims that we do violence to ourselves as human beings by trying to fit into the world as delineated in scientific categories. Rejecting cultural subjectivism and scientific naturalism, he argues for the irreducibility and validity of the categories of the humanities and for a fully developed humanistic philosophy of self and world. In generating this world-view, he utilizes the humanities as a source of culture therapy in order to close the fissure in Western civilization. Author note: E. M. Adams is Kenan Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He has written numerous books and articles, and a festschrift celebrating his work, Mind, Value, and Culture: Essays in Honor of E. M. Adams (edited by David Weissbord), was published in 1989.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VGlEIioFaGoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VGlEIioFaGoC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VGlEIioFaGoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api

In this book, Penelope Maddy describes and practises a particularly austere form of naturalism called 'Second Philosophy'. Without a definitive criterion for what counts as 'science' and what doesn't, Second Philosophy can't be specified directly - 'trust only the methods of science!' or some such thing - so Maddy proceeds instead by illustratingthe behaviours of an idealized inquirer she calls the 'Second Philosopher'. This Second Philosopher begins from perceptual common sense and progresses from there to systematic observation, active experimentation, theory formation and testing, working all the while to assess, correct and improve hermethods as she goes. Second Philosophy is then the result of the Second Philosopher's investigations.Maddy delineates the Second Philosopher's approach by tracing her reactions to various familiar skeptical and transcendental views (Descartes, Kant, Carnap, late Putnam, van Fraassen), comparing her methods to those of other self-described naturalists (especially Quine), and examining a prominent contemporary debate (between disquotationalists and correspondence theorists in the theory of truth) to extract a properly second-philosophical line of thought. She then undertakes to practise SecondPhilosophy in her reflections on the ground of logical truth, the methodology, ontology and epistemology of mathematics, and the general prospects for metaphysics naturalized.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ILqnMEz6_vEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ILqnMEz6_vEC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ILqnMEz6_vEC&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api

Rather, the authors were asked to make an original synthesis of their own contributions to the field of legal theory and legal philosophy.

Peperzak's examination begins with a general overview of Levinas's life and thought, and shows how issues of ethics, politics, and religion are intertwined in Levinas's philosophy.

To that end he examines the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical boundaries of these medical models. He begins with their metaphysics, analyzing the metaphysical positions and presuppositions and ontological commitments upon which medical knowledge and practice is founded. Next, he considers the epistemological issues that face these medical models, particularly those driven by methodological procedures undertaken by epistemic agents to constitute medical knowledge and practice. Finally, he examines the axiological boundaries and the ethical implications of each model, especially in terms of the physician-patient relationship. In a concluding Epilogue, he discusses how the philosophical analysis of the humanization of modern medicine helps to address the crisis-of-care, as well as the question of “What is medicine?” The book’s unique features include a comprehensive coverage of the various topics in the philosophy of medicine that have emerged over the past several decades and a philosophical context for embedding bioethical discussions. The book’s target audiences include both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as healthcare professionals and professional philosophers. “This book is the 99th issue of the Series Philosophy and Medicine...and it can be considered a crown of thirty years of intensive and dynamic discussion in the field.

Dray in the philosophy of history. In this expanded version of the original symposium, to which Professor Dray has provided a critical response, a group of prominent philosophers and historians address the central questions posed by contemporary philosophy of history - such as, the logic and methodology of historical explanation, the selection and uses of evidence, the fact/value relationship, the nature of historical causation, the question of conflicting interpretations and their possible resolution, the idea of history as a school of practical wisdom, and the question whether history has any discernable pattern or meaning. These issues are approached from the experience of both historians and philosophers and represent an important increment to the long-standing and continuing debates concerning the nature and aims of the practice and philosophy of history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZqgrTvRBqtwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZqgrTvRBqtwC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZqgrTvRBqtwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api

D5Hk8EkmQBcC,A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals,Rajendra Prasad,Ethics,2008,Concept Publishing Company,,,496,"Using recontructive ideas available in classical Indian original works, this book makes a departure in the style of modern writings on Indian moral philosophy. It presents Indian ethics, in an objective, secular, and wherever necessary, critical manner as a systematic, down-to-earth, philosophical account of moral values, virtues, rights and obligations. It thereby refutes the claim that Indian philosophy has no ethics as well as the counter-claim that it transcends ethics. It demonstrates that moral living proves that the individual, his society and the world are really real and not only taken to be real for behavioral purposes as the Advaitins hold, the self is amoral being a non-agent, moksa is not a moral value, and the Karmic theory, because of involving belief in rebirth, does not fuarantee that the doer of an action is also the experiencer of its results, contrary to what is commonly held, and Indian ethics can sustain itself even if such notions are dropped. Rajendra Prasad calls Indian ethics organismic because, along with ethical concerns, it also covers issues related to professions, politics, administration, sex, environment, etc. Therefore, in one format it is theoretical and applied, normative and metaethical, humanistic and non-humanistic, etc., of course, within the limits of the then cognitive enquiry.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D5Hk8EkmQBcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=D5Hk8EkmQBcC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=D5Hk8EkmQBcC&pg=PA34&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api

Pu4dvAEe6gsC,Thinking about Thinking,Adriaan Theodoor Peperzak,Philosophy,2012,Fordham Univ Press,,,225,"Thinking about Thinking examines philosophy from a variety of perspectives as a the practice realized by persons who communicate with one another while reflecting about the meaning of human life and thought. Without forgetting the logical and methodological conditions of systematic thought, the author insists on the intimate connections that tie all philosophical texts and conversations to the lives from which they emerge. As product of an individual thinker, who, thanks to individual teachers, has been familiarized with particular traditions of a particular culture, each philosophy is unique. If it is a good one, it is also revealing for many--perhaps even for all--other philosophers. At the same time, all thinking is addressed to individual interlocutors, each of whom responds to it by transforming it into a different philosophy. This fact invites us to explore the dialogical dimension of thinking, which, in turn, refers us to the communitarian and historical contexts from which solitude, as well as solidarity, competition, alliances, and friendships in thought emerge. After the collapse of modern autonomy, the question of philosophy's dependence on prephilosophical conditions is a basic question of metaphilosophy -- especially if a philosophy is always entangled with or even rooted in some belief or trust or faith.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pu4dvAEe6gsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Pu4dvAEe6gsC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Pu4dvAEe6gsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api

Are the writings that have come down to us over the centuries from philosophers of genius mere souvenirs from a bygone era? Or are their thoughts still eminently worth examining with care? Modern Challenges to Past Philosophy argues pondering past philosophy with modern problems in mind is worth the effort, even though earlier works are uninformed by modern science and lack some of tools of modern analysis. The great texts defamiliarize our world and offer solutions to crucial questions often forgotten as we fixate on current philosophical trends.

QGofzgEACAAJ,Philosophy of Perception,WILLIAM. FISH,Uncategorized,2021-06-18,Routledge,,,,"The philosophy of perception investigates the nature of our sensory experiences and their relation to reality. In the Second Edition of this popular book, William Fish introduces the subject thematically, setting out the major theories of perception together with their motivations and attendant problems. While providing historical background to debates in the field, this comprehensive overview focuses on recent presentations and defenses of the different theories, and looks beyond visual perception to take into account the role of other senses. The Second Edition organizes the contents into two main parts: the first deals with philosophical theories of perception, and the second covers key topics and issues in perception as they are discussed in philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology. Two completely new chapters have been added - one on color and color vision; and a second on the interaction between sense modalities - and other chapters have been significantly updated to include discussion of topics such as pre-20th century philosophy of perception, phenomenal intentionality, color adverbialism, predictive processing approaches to perception, ecological approaches to perception, and in-depth discussions of the non-visual senses. Additional updates include fuller and easier-to-understand explanations of some important views that were glossed over in the first edition and greater coverage of research from the last 25 years. All chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter have been brought up to date and the volume now includes a glossary and a more extensive index at the back of the book. Key Features and Benefits: The only single-authored textbook on philosophy of perception currently available Devoted to contemporary theories and topics, but with appropriate historical coverage for fuller understanding of contemporary work Each chapter includes a chapter overview, questions for further consideration, and an annotated list of Suggested Readings Includes coverage of topics like: - the phenomenal principle - perception and hallucination - perception and content - naïve realism and disjunctivismintentionalism and representationalism - the nature of content - qualia theories and phenomenal intentionality - perception and empirical science - color and color science - theories of non-visual perception - Molyneux's problem - cross-modal illusions - multimodality Key Changes to the Second Edition The division of the book into two major parts: Part I on philosophical theories of perception, Part II on key interdisciplinary topics in perception The addition of two new chapters on color and color vision, and interaction between different sense modalities More topics from the last 25 years of philosophy of perception Combined chapters on belief acquisition theories and intentional theories into one larger chapter More material on the growing intersection of the philosophy and psychology of perception Includes coverage of Molyneux's problem and of cross-modal illusions Updated chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter A glossary and more extensive index",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QGofzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QGofzgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QGofzgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api

Maraldo",Philosophy,2011-07-31,University of Hawaii Press,,,1362,"With Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook, readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time. The Sourcebook editors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition—not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics. An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index. Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use, Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook will be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come. It will be an essential reference for anyone interested in traditional or contemporary Japanese culture and the way it has shaped and been shaped by its great thinkers over the centuries.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GVgEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GVgEEAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GVgEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api

The newspaper has a readership of over a million, and reaches millions more with its spin-off books and Onion News Network. The Onion has shown us that standard ways of thinking about the news have their grotesque and silly side, and this invites philosophical examination. Twenty-one philosophers were commissioned to provide witty philosophical perspectives on just what makes the Onion so truthful and insightful. Former Governor Sarah Palin reported: “I just couldn’t put it down. The Onion and Philosophy is the most exciting book I’ve read since Principia Mathematica.” Are the Onion writers truly cynical, or just cynically faking it? Does the Onion really have a serious point of view on religion? On sex? On politics? Who cares what Area Man thinks?

av9pzgEACAAJ,Philosophy and Management Studies,"Raza A. Mir, Michelle Greenwood",Management,2021-08,,,,,"""Irrespective of whether one thinks of philosophy explicitly, each organizational researcher is a philosopher. A philosophical position is predicated on a variety of approaches relating to ontology, epistemology, methodology, ethics, and political positions. Depending on where one stands with regard to these philosophical building blocks, their orientation may be characterized as positivist, realist, critical-realist and constructivist, with pragmatist and political considerations weighing in as well. Also, management theories all inhabit the same spectrum of philosophical positions that enrich them and add to their relevance to the world of firms and organizations. To that end, this book provides a broad-based commentary on the terrain of philosophy as it pertains to management studies, especially for the relatively unfamiliar organizational theorist. This book provides as a succinct overview of the field of management philosophy as well as a roadmap for to those readers who wish to explore the terrain further. The book argues that all knowledge inquiry invokes philosophy and philosophical thinking, and that the artificial separation between philosophy and social science is fallacious. Just as philosophy is everywhere, so is power, and for better or worse they go hand in hand. Hence, philosophical positions are political positions. The authors do not shy from addressing the politics of their own research practice or the subjects of their inquiry. Philosophy and Management Studies targets a new generation of management researchers, whose interest in philosophy vastly exceeds their resources to engage with it, partly because of their unfamiliarity with its often mystifying and outsider-unfriendly conventions. It seeks to bridge the chasm between interest in philosophy in organizational studies and knowledge about it. It is not for the trained philosopher or the expert, but for a relative newcomer""--",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=av9pzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=av9pzgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=av9pzgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api

Evangeliou examines the historical influence of Hellenic philosophy and its complex global relations to other non-Hellenic philosophies of Africa, Asia and Europe and also considers certain contemporary and sensitive issues, which relate to the nature of Western culture and European philosophy. Radical and revisionary in nature, this work challenges many of the long cherished myths about the influence of Classical Hellenic philosophy on the tradition of Western thought.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fbpOJxng5ksC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fbpOJxng5ksC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fbpOJxng5ksC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api
NdGKzgEACAAJ,The Principles of Moral and Christian Philosophy,George Turnbull,Christian ethics,2005,,,,0,"Presents the first masterpiece of Scottish Common Sense philosophy. This two-volume treatise is important for its wide range of insights about the nature of the human mind, the foundations of morals, and the relationship between morality and religion. In order to understand the Enlightenment in Scotland, Turnbull's work must be put next to that of Francis Hutcheson. In the first volume Turnbull presents a detailed study of the faculties of the human mind and their interrelations. He contends that moral philosophy should be treated as one part, the highest part, of natural philosophy, and not as a field requiring its own distinctive methodology. Moral philosophers should rely on observation and experiment as their means of exploration into the workings of the human mind.

It is funded by Knowledge Unlatched. Philosophy in a Meaningless Life provides an account of the nature of philosophy which is rooted in the question of the meaning of life. It makes a powerful and vivid case for believing that this question is neither obscure nor obsolete, but reflects a quintessentially human concern to which other traditional philosophical problems can be readily related; allowing them to be reconnected with natural interest, and providing a diagnosis of the typical lines of opposition across philosophy's debates. James Tartaglia looks at the various ways philosophers have tried to avoid the conclusion that life is meaningless, and in the process have distanced philosophy from the concept of transcendence. Rejecting all of this, Tartaglia embraces nihilism ('we are here with nothing to do'), and uses transcendence both to provide a new solution to the problem of consciousness, and to explain away perplexities about time and universals. He concludes that with more self-awareness, philosophy can attain higher status within a culture increasingly in need of it.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H_xaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=H_xaEAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=H_xaEAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api
r0zZYYoytPkC,Philosophy and the Arts,Bert Olivier,Architecture,2009,Peter Lang,,,260,"This collection of philosophical essays addresses important issues in the arts, encompassing painting, sculpture, photography, film and architecture. The author's point of departure is the conviction that art in all its manifestations is an extremely significant cultural practice because it embodies a creative, reflective appropriation of social, political, economic, religious, historical and ecological developments, and as such merits close philosophical scrutiny, reflection and interpretation. The question of whether painting is still a viable artistic practice in our technocratic society is considered here, and it is no accident that both this issue and that of artificial intelligence are approached from the perspective of the phenomenological thought of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, among other thinkers. Equally important is the consideration of the relationship between art and the ethical, as highlighted by significant recent artistic events, as well as discussion of the transformational influence of ecological art and the culturally symptomatic meaning of kitsch. Other themes discussed include play and artistic tradition, formulating a suitable model for art 'beyond' Kierkegaard's aesthetic and ethical models, the meaning of 9/11 for architecture, and Lyotard's claim that today only an aesthetic of the sublime, instead of the beautiful, can help us make sense of art.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r0zZYYoytPkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=r0zZYYoytPkC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=r0zZYYoytPkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api

The positions of such philosophers as Socrates, Spinoza, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Foucault, and Derrida differ in almost every respect, yet these thinkers all share a common method of practicing philosophy--not as a detached, intellectual discipline, but as a worldly art. What is the love that turns into knowledge and how is the knowledge we seek already a form of love? Reading key texts from Socrates to Derrida, this book addresses the fundamental tension between love and knowledge that informs the history of Western philosophy. LoveKnowledge returns to the long tradition of philosophy as an exercise not only of the mind but also of the soul, asking whether philosophy can shape and inform our lives and communities.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LSD_LwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LSD_LwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LSD_LwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api
5sPLDAAAQBAJ,The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization,Arran Gare,Nature,2016-08-05,Routledge,,,271,"The global ecological crisis is the greatest challenge humanity has ever had to confront, and humanity is failing. The triumph of the neo-liberal agenda, together with a debauched ‘scientism’, has reduced nature and people to nothing but raw materials, instruments and consumers to be efficiently managed in a global market dominated by corporate managers, media moguls and technocrats. The arts and the humanities have been devalued, genuine science has been crippled, and the quest for autonomy and democracy undermined. The resultant trajectory towards global ecological destruction appears inexorable, and neither governments nor environmental movements have significantly altered this, or indeed, seem able to. The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization is a wide-ranging and scholarly analysis of this failure. This book reframes the dynamics of the debate beyond the discourses of economics, politics and techno-science. Reviving natural philosophy to align science with the humanities, it offers the categories required to reform our modes of existence and our institutions so that we augment, rather than undermine, the life of the ecosystems of which we are part. From this philosophical foundation, the author puts forth a manifesto for transforming our culture into one which could provide an effective global environmental movement and provide the foundations for a global ecological civilization.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5sPLDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5sPLDAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5sPLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api

What emerges from his explorations is a revivified version of pragmatism that offers new hope for the future of philosophy.""Rorty's dazzling tour through the history of modern philosophy, and his critical account of its present state (the best general introduction in print), is actually an argument that what we consider perennial problems--mind and body, consciousness and objects, the foundations of knowledge, the fact/value distinction--are merely the dead-ends this picture leads us into."" Los Angeles Times Book Review""It can immediately be said that Consequences of Pragmatism must be read by both those who believe that they agree and those who believe that they disagree with Richard Rorty. [He] is far and away the most provocative philosophical writer working in North America today, and Consequences of Pragmatism should make this claim even stronger.""The Review of Metaphysics""Philosophy, for Rorty, is a form of writing, a literary genre, closer to literary criticism than anything else, a criticism which takes for one of its major concerns the texts of the past recognized as philosophical: it interprets interpretations.

HYWLxAEACAAJ,BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL - Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future: The Critique of the Traditional Morality and the Philosophy of the Past,"Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Helen Zimmern",Philosophy,2019-04-15,E-Artnow,,,116,"Beyond Good and Evil is a philosophical book by Friedrich Nietzsche, in which he draws on and expands the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but with a more critical and polemical approach. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm ""beyond good and evil"" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favor of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspective nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual. Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on Western philosophy and modern intellectual history. Before turning to philosophy, he began his career as a philologist and worked at the Department of Classical Philology at the University of Basel, but he had to retire due to health problems. Nietzsche's body of writing spanned philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism and fiction, and drew widely on art, philology, history, religion and science. His writing displayed a fondness for aphorism and irony, while engaging with a wide range of subjects including morality, aesthetics, tragedy, epistemology, atheism, and consciousness.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HYWLxAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HYWLxAEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HYWLxAEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api

An essential new reference tool for those interested in his thinking, Nietzsche’s Philosophical Context identifies the chronology and huge range of philosophical books that engaged him.

Brobjer consulted over two thousand volumes in Nietzsche’s personal library, as well as his book bills, library records, journals, letters, and publications. This meticulous investigation also considers many of the annotations in his books. In arguing that Nietzsche’s reading often constituted the starting point for, or counterpoint to, much of his own thinking and writing, Brobjer’s study provides scholars with fresh insight into how Nietzsche worked and thought; to which questions and thinkers he responded; and by which of them he was influenced.

The Philosopher does just that, providing a new way of looking at the history of philosophy by bringing to life six kinds of figures who have occupied the role of philosopher in a wide range of societies around the world over the millennia—the Natural Philosopher, the Sage, the Gadfly, the Ascetic, the Mandarin, and the Courtier. The result is at once an unconventional introduction to the global history of philosophy and an original exploration of what philosophy has been—and perhaps could be again. By uncovering forgotten or neglected philosophical job descriptions, the book reveals that philosophy is a universal activity, much broader—and more gender inclusive—than we normally think today.

Postmodern Emerson shows how Emersonian skepticism to metanarratives such as sexism, racism, Beauvoiran ""serious values,"" and others, can help us face some of society's gravest contemporary social and philosophical challenges. Methodologically, the book exemplifies Emersonian postmodernism by defying traditional philosophical metanarratives about the difference between high and low culture or serious and ridiculous subjects, and Emerson with what would seem to be his opposite.

OA5scxRVl60C,A Philosopher's Apprentice,Joseph Agassi,Biography & Autobiography,2008,Rodopi,,,402,"Both a Popper biography and an autobiography, Agassi's ""A Philosopher's Apprentice"" tells the riveting story of his intellectual formation in 1950s London, a young brilliant philosopher struggling with an intellectual giant - father, mentor, and rival, all at the same time. His subsequent rebellion and declaration of independence leads to a painful break, never to be completely healed. No other writer has Agassi's psychological insight into Popper, and no other book captures like this one the intellectual excitement around the Popper circle in the 1950s and the struggles of the 1960s and 1970s - personal, academic, political, all important philosophically. Agassi's Popper - whether one agrees with it or not - is an enormous contribution to scholarship. This second revised edition includes also Popper's and Agassi's last correspondence and, in a postscript it shows Agassi leafing through Popper's archives, reaching a sort of reconciliation, an appropriate ending to the drama.

By critically discussing and weaving together these contributions in terms of their philosophical presuppositions, this cutting-edge volume initiates a more sophisticated, albeit diverse, understanding of doing comparative philosophy. Within a broad conception of the alternative shapes that work in philosophy may take, this volume breaks three kinds of boundaries: between cultures, historical periods and sub-disciplines of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. As well as distinguishing three phases of the development of comparative philosophy up to the present day, the editors argue why the discipline now needs to enter a new phase. Putting to use philosophical thought and textual sources from Eurasia and Africa, contributors discuss modern psychological and cognitive science approaches to the nature of mind and topics as different as perception, poetry, justice, authority, and the very possibility of understanding other people. Comparative Philosophy without Borders demonstrates how drawing on philosophical resources from across cultural traditions can produce sound state-of-the-art progressive philosophy.

Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics: If it is uncertain that external objects exist, how can we then have knowledge of them but by probability. There is no reason to doubt the existence of external objects simply because of sense data.Russell guides the reader through his famous 1910 distinction between ""knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description"" and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, René Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike."" In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.""",,http://books.google.com/books?id=QyL2ZwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QyL2ZwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api

3x7yTZvih0MC,An Introduction to African Legal Philosophy,John Murungi,Philosophy,2013-04-11,Lexington Books,,,241,"A book on legal philosophy, necessarily, focuses attention on law. In addition to this focus, An Introduction to an African Legal Philosophy focuses attention on philosophy. The link between law and philosophy is brought into relief, which is done through an African context. An attempt is made to spell out what is African about legal philosophy without being cut off of African legal philosophy from non-African legal philosophy. The book draws attention to the view that a basic component of African legal philosophy consists of an investigation of what it is to be an African, and because an African is a human being among other human beings, the investigation is about what it is to be a human being. Ubuntuism is an African-derived word that captures this mode of being human. Moreover, because human beings are cultural beings, African cultural context guides the investigation. Inescapably, it is claimed that, every legal philosophy is embedded in a culture. African legal philosophy is not an exception. It is deeply rooted in African culture –a culture that is today shaped, in part, by a European colonialist culture. One feature that will strike one as one reads the book is that the book approaches African legal philosophy as a means of decolonization of African culture. African legal philosophy can accomplish this intelligently and effectively if it is itself decolonized. In doing this it contrasts sharply with mainstream Western legal philosophy.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3x7yTZvih0MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3x7yTZvih0MC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3x7yTZvih0MC&pg=PA9&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api

Hyland, one of Continental philosophy's keenest interpreters of Plato, takes up the question of beauty in three Platonic dialogues, the Hippias Major, Symposium, and Phaedrus. What Plato meant by beauty is not easily characterized, and Hyland's close readings show that Plato ultimately gives up on the possibility of a definition. Plato's failure, however, tells us something important about beauty—that it cannot be reduced to logos. Exploring questions surrounding love, memory, and ideal form, Hyland draws out the connections between beauty, the possibility of philosophy, and philosophical living. This new reading of Plato provides a serious investigation into the meaning of beauty and places it at the very heart of philosophy.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C1LaszjLNawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=C1LaszjLNawC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=C1LaszjLNawC&pg=PA134&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api

Torralba",Philosophy,2016-02-01,Georg Olms Verlag,,,271,"Die in diesem Band versammelten Essays erörtern die Frage nach der Möglichkeit des Verstehens menschlichen Handelns ohne den Rückbezug auf moralische Werte und Normen. Obwohl die Autoren sich dieser Frage auf ganz unterschiedliche, manchmal divergierende, Weisen nähern, verbindet sie alle die Annahme, es sei nicht wünschenswert oder sogar inkohärent, das menschliche Handeln grundsätzlich unabhängig von moralischen Werten zu betrachten. Die Herausgeber haben sich um eine für Philosophen und Gesellschaftswissenschaftler gleichermaßen attraktive Beitragssammlung bemüht. Die Verknüpfung philosophischer und soziologischer Perspektiven könnte zur Klärung gegenseitiger Missverständnisse beitragen, die aufgrund eines mangelhaften Dialogs zwischen der philosophischen und soziologischen Handlungstheorie erwachsen sind. In diesem Band enthalten sind Essays von Terry Pinkard, Sebastian Rödl, Dieter Schönecker, Ana Marta González, John Levi Martin, Alejandro N. García Martínez, Sophie Djigo, Teresa Enríquez und Evgenia Mylonaki. The essays in this volume address the question of whether we can understand human action without reference to moral norms or values. Although the authors approach this question in different and sometimes even incompatible ways, they are united in thinking that it is undesirable or even incoherent to treat human agency as if it were conceptually independent of value questions. The editors have attempted to invite contributions that would be interesting to both philosophers and social theorists. The conjunction of philosophic and sociological perspectives might help to overcome some of the mutual misunderstandings that have been fostered by a lack of dialogue between the philosophic and sociological action theory.

Kl6mDwAAQBAJ,Between Psychology and Philosophy,Michael Slote,Philosophy,2019-07-30,Springer,,,222,"This open access book discusses a variety of important but unprecedented ways in which psychology can be useful to philosophy. The early chapters illustrate this theme via comparisons between Chinese and Western philosophy. It is argued that the Chinese notion of a heart-mind is superior to the Western concept of mind, but then, more even-handedly, the relative strengths and weaknesses of Chinese and Western thought overall are critically examined. In later chapters, the philosophical uses of psychology are treated more specifically in relation to major issues in Western philosophy. Michael Slote shows that empathy and emotion play a role in speech acts (like assertion and thanking) that speech act theory has totally ignored. Similarly, he treats the age-old question of whether justice pays using psychological material that has not previously been recognized. Finally, the implications of psychological egoism are discussed in terms of some new psychological and, indeed, human distinctions. Human life is pervaded by instincts and aspirations that are neither egoistic nor altruistic, and recognizing that fact can help put egoism in its place. It is less of a challenge to morality than we have realized.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kl6mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Kl6mDwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Kl6mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api

The Dream of Enlightenment tells their story and that of the birth of modern philosophy. What does the advance of science entail for our understanding of ourselves and for our ideas of God? How should a government deal with religious diversity - and what is government actually for? Their questions remain our questions, and it is tempting to think these philosophers speak our language and live in our world; but to understand them properly, we must step back into their shoes. Gottlieb puts readers in the minds of these frequently misinterpreted figures, elucidating the history of their times while engagingly explaining their arguments and assessing their legacy.

dRPWbD9ly04C,Spheres of Reason,Simon Robertson,Philosophy,2009-10-01,OUP Oxford,,,579,"Spheres of Reason comprises nine original essays on the philosophy of normativity, written by a combination of internationally renowned and up-and-coming philosophers working at the forefront of the topic. On one broad construal the normative sphere concerns norms, requirements, oughts, reasons, reasoning, rationality, justification, value. These notions play a central role in both everyday thought and philosophical enquiry; but there remains considerable disagreement about how to understand normativity -- its nature, metaphysical and epistemological bases -- and how different aspects of normative thought connect to one another. As well as exploring traditional and ongoing issues central to our understanding of normativity -- especially those concerning reasons, reasoning and rationality -- the volume's essays develop new approaches to and perspectives in the field. Notably, they make a timely and distinctive contribution to normativity as it features across each of the practical, epistemic and affective regions of thought, including the important issue of how normativity as it applies to action, belief and feeling may (or may not) be connected. In doing so, the essays engage topics within the philosophy of mind and action, epistemology, normative ethics and metaethics.

In February 1988, philosophers Jacques Derrida, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe came together in Heidelberg before a large audience to discuss the philosophical and political implications of Martin Heidegger’s thought. Heidegger’s involvement in Nazism has always been an unsettling stain on his legacy. But what is its real relation to his work in phenomenology or hermeneutics? What are the responsibilities of those who read, analyze, and elaborate this thought? And what is at stake should this important but compromised philosopher be completely dismissed? The reflections presented by three of the most prominent of Heidegger’s readers, spoken in French and transcribed here, were an attempt to approach these questions before a broad public while maintaining a nuanced view of the questions at issue. Ranging over two days and including exchanges with one another and with the audience, the discussions pursued by these major thinkers remain highly relevant today.

While modern moral philosophy has focused its energies on normative and metaethical theory, the task of describing, uncovering, and inquiring into moral frameworks and moral practices has mainly been left to social scientists and historians. Nora Hämäläinen argues that this division of labour has detrimental consequences for moral philosophy and that a reorientation toward descriptive work is needed in moral philosophy.

The book engages major African and Western philosophers of diverse ideological leanings in a compelling dialogue that announces the future of world philosophy as one of interculturality, in which a common philosophical horizon is forged out of the cultural diversities of the world for the edification of humanity in a continually changing world.

Michael Forster seeks to rectify that situation He considers Herder's philosophy in the round and argues that it is both far more impressive in quality and far more influential in modern thought than has previously been realized. After an introduction on Herder's intellectual biography, philosophical style, and general program in philosophy, there are chapters on his philosophy of language, his hermeneutics, his theory of translation, his contribution of the philosophical foundations for both linguistics and cultural anthropology, his philosophy of mind, his aesthetics, his moral philosophy, his philosophy of history, his political philosophy, his philosophy of religion, and his intellectual influence. Forster argues that Herder contributed vitally important ideas in all of these areas; that in many of them his ideas were seminal for major subsequent philosophers, including Friedrich Schlegel, Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Hegel, and Nietzsche; that they indeed founded whole new disciplines, such as linguistics, anthropology, and comparative literature; and that moreover they were in many cases even better than what these subsequent thinkers and disciplines went on to make of them.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GpVqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GpVqDwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GpVqDwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=130&source=gbs_api

5ZCAswEACAAJ,The Philosophy of History (Classic Reprint),Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,Philosophy,2017-11-08,Forgotten Books,,,494,"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's The Philosophy of History contains an edited series of lectures delivered by Hegel, a noted German philosopher and a key figure in German Idealism whose words and theories are studied to this day. The essays contained in this book provide a history of the world as viewed through a Hegelian perspective. Hegel attempts to trace the history of consciousness through studying some of the world's great societies. The philosopher argues that history is constructed with reason as the guiding principle. This book selects a number of different societies and explores their history in depth. China, India, Persia, Greece, Rome, and Germany are all examined within this work. While world history is the subject matter of this book, many readers approach this book with the intention of learning more about Hegel's philosophy. Indeed, much of the book is spent explaining Hegel's concept of ""Geist,"" or spirit. Hegel believes history can be interpreted as a manifestation of the human spirit, and it is through this lens that The Philosophy of History operates. This series of essays serves as some of Hegel's most accessible work, and is thus a valid entry point for students of German Idealism and the author's philosophy as a whole. The book can still be quite challenging at times, and readers may want to familiarize themselves with Hegel's terminology before endeavoring to read this nearly 500-page work. The Philosophy of History stands up as one of the best introductions to German Idealism, and is thus recommended to all students and scholars of philosophy.

-tcyDwAAQBAJ,The Philosophy of Ontological Lateness,Keith Whitmoyer,Philosophy,2017-09-07,Bloomsbury Publishing,,,224,"Addressing Merleau-Ponty's work Phenomenology of Perception, in dialogue with The Visible and the Invisible, his lectures at the Collège de France, and his reading of Proust, this book argues that at play in his thought is a philosophy of “ontological lateness”. This describes the manner in which philosophical reflection is fated to lag behind its objects; therefore an absolute grasp on being remains beyond its reach. Merleau-Ponty articulates this philosophy against the backdrop of what he calls “cruel thought”, a style of reflecting that seeks resolution by limiting, circumscribing, and arresting its object. By contrast, the philosophy of ontological lateness seeks no such finality-no apocalypsis or unveiling-but is characterized by its ability to accept the veiling of being and its own constitutive lack of punctuality. To this extent, his thinking inaugurates a new relation to the becoming of sense that overcomes cruel thought. Merleau-Ponty's work gives voice to a wisdom of dispossession that allows for the withdrawal of being. Never before has anyone engaged with the theme of Merleau-Ponty's own understanding of philosophy in such a sustained way as Whitmoyer does in this volume.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-tcyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-tcyDwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-tcyDwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=136&source=gbs_api

2pDtCAAAQBAJ,In the Shadow of Descartes,G.H. Von Wright,Philosophy,2013-03-09,Springer Science & Business Media,,,189,"Descartes made a sharp distinction between matter and mind. But he also thought that the two interact with one another. Is such interaction possible, however, without either a materialist reduction of mind to matter or an idealist (phenomenalist) reduction of matter to mind? These questions overshadow the Western tradition in metaphysics from the time of Descartes to present times. The book makes an effort to stay clear of reductivist views of the two Cartesian substances. It defends a dualistic psycho-physical parallel theory which reconciles freedom of action with determinism in nature. Basic problems in perception theory are also discussed, with special emphasis on hearing and sound. Because of the intrinsic interest of the subject and the author's non-technical presentation of it, the book should appeal to all readers with a serious interest in philosophy and psychology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2pDtCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2pDtCAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2pDtCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=139&source=gbs_api

The aim of this collection is to highlight the continuing importance of Sellars' work to contemporary debates. The contributors include several luminaries in Sellars scholarship, as well as members of the new generation whose work demonstrates the lasting power of Sellars' ideas. Papers by O'Shea and Koons develop Sellars' underexplored views concerning ethics, practical reasoning, and free will, with an emphasis on his longstanding engagement with Kant. Sachs, Hicks and Pereplyotchik relate Sellars' views of mental phenomena to current topics in cognitive science and philosophy of mind. Fink, deVries, Price, Macbeth, Christias, and Brandom grapple with traditional Sellarsian themes, including meaning, truth, existence, and objectivity. Brandhoff provides an original account of the evolution of Sellars' philosophy of language and his project of ""pure pragmatics"".

Through a collection of vivid narratives, the book situates philosophy of higher education by embodying the doctoral researcher and their initiation into academic life, revealing how doctoral pursuits in African higher education are not simply academic endeavours but deeply philosophical adventures that challenge, critique, and reimagine the role of education in society. Chapters advocate for a dynamic educational system that, rooted in African philosophies, nurtures democratic citizenship, embraces critical engagement, and fosters social justice. A call to action for researchers, students, and policy makers alike to view doctoral research as a powerful catalyst for change, the book offers fresh perspectives on addressing the continent's unique challenges, contributing to a more just and inclusive world. Ultimately considering the potential of academic research to shape the future of societies, both within Africa and globally, the book will appeal to researchers, academics and postgraduate students involved with the philosophy of education, higher education, and citizenship education, as well as these areas in African contexts specifically.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_cfEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1_cfEQAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1_cfEQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1984&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=148&source=gbs_api

Patil",Philosophy,2010-10-14,Columbia University Press,,,217,"Jnanasrimitra (975-1025) was regarded by both Buddhists and non-Buddhists as the most important Indian philosopher of his generation. His theory of exclusion combined a philosophy of language with a theory of conceptual content to explore the nature of words and thought. Jnanasrimitra's theory informed much of the work accomplished at Vikramasila, a monastic and educational complex instrumental to the growth of Buddhism. His ideas were also passionately debated among successive Hindu and Jain philosophers. This volume marks the first English translation of Jnanasrimitra's Monograph on Exclusion, a careful, critical investigation into language, perception, and conceptual awareness. Featuring the rival arguments of Buddhist and Hindu intellectuals, among other thinkers, the Monograph reflects more than half a millennium of competing claims while providing an invaluable introduction to a crucial philosopher. Lawrence J. McCrea and Parimal G. Patil familiarize the reader with the author, themes, and topics of the text and situate Jnanasrimitra's findings within his larger intellectual milieu.

Hinlicky",Philosophy,2013-04-11,A&C Black,,,436,"The debate between faith and reason has been a dominant feature of Western thought for more than two millennia. This book takes up the problem of the relation between philosophy and theology and proposes that this relation can be reconceived if both philosophy and theology are seen as different ways of organising affects. Brent Adkins and Paul R. Hinlicky break new ground in this timely debate in two ways. Firstly, they lay bare the contemporary dependence on Kant and propose that our Kantian inheritance leaves us with an insuperable dualism. Secondly, the authors argue that the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze provides a way of resolving the debate between faith and reason that does justice to philosophy and theology by reconceiving of both as assemblages. Deleuze's philosophy differentiates domains of thought in terms of what they create. This seems like a particularly fruitful way to pursue the problem of the relations among philosophy and theology because it allows their distinction without at the same time placing them in opposition to one another.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HPwZBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HPwZBgAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HPwZBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=154&source=gbs_api
8bBMnwEACAAJ,Active Perception in the History of Philosophy,"José Filipe Silva, Mikko Yrjönsuuri",Philosophy,2014-04-01,Springer,,,0,"The aim of the present work is to show the roots of the conception of perception as an active process, tracing the history of its development from Plato to modern philosophy. The contributors inquire into what activity is taken to mean in different theories, challenging traditional historical accounts of perception that stress the passivity of percipients in coming to know the external world. Special attention is paid to the psychological and physiological mechanisms of perception, rational and non-rational perception and the role of awareness in the perceptual process. Perception has often been conceived as a process in which the passive aspects - such as the reception of sensory stimuli - were stressed and the active ones overlooked. However, during recent decades research in cognitive science and philosophy of mind has emphasized the activity of the subject in the process of sense perception, often associating this activity to the notions of attention and intentionality. Although it is recognized that there are ancient roots to the view that perception is fundamentally active, the history remains largely unexplored. The book is directed to all those interested in contemporary debates in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive psychology who would like to become acquainted with the historical background of active perception, but for historical reliability the aim is to make no compromises.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8bBMnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8bBMnwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8bBMnwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=155&source=gbs_api

Zeno's dizzying 'proofs' that motion is impossible; the extraordinary atomic theories of Democritus; the haunting and enigmatic epigrams of Heraclitus; and the maxims of Alcmaeon: fragmentary as they often are, the thoughts of these philosophers seem strikingly modern in their concern to forge a truly scientific vocabulary and way of reasoning.

Together, these writers, artists, and activists created an inimitably American cultural phenomenon that would have a global influence. In their constant search for meaning, the Beats struggled with anxiety, alienation, and their role as the pioneers of the cultural revolution of the 1960s. The Philosophy of the Beats explores the enduring literary, cultural, and philosophical contributions of the Beats in a variety of contexts. Editor Sharin N. Elkholy has gathered leading scholars in Beat studies and philosophy to analyze the cultural, literary, and biographical aspects of the movement, including the drug experience in the works of Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, feminism and the Beat heroine in Diane Di Prima's writings, Gary Snyder's environmental ethics, and the issue of self in Bob Kaufman's poetry.

TX_H1ac2jqEC,The Common Things,Daniel McInerny,Education,1999,CUA Press,,,300,"Concerned with the trendy, technocratic, and at times sophistical character of contemporary education at all levels, both public and private, the authors of this collection seek to reinvigorate a Thomistic approach to education appropriate to the problems of our day. With its main inspiration taken from the work of Jacques Maritain, especially his 1943 Education at the Crossroads, the volume presents a trenchant critique of the ""privacies"" of contemporary education, with its emphasis upon the conventional and useful. At the same time, the essays present the outlines of the proper alternative, an education which helps students draw out from themselves the desire for truths which transcend the contingencies of culture and utility. Such an education seeks to guide students to ""the common things"" available to all human beings. The essays uphold an account of man's intellectual and affective capacities which understands these capacities as naturally ordered to truth. The essays approach the task in different but complementary ways: in critiques of contemporary theories of education, in speculative accounts of knowledge and learning, in applications of theory to specific institutional settings, and in discussions of the political contexts governing modern education. In this rich variety of ways, the essays in The Common Things not only point the way back to the crossroads Maritain spoke of fifty years ago; they go on to indicate something of the landscape along the road not taken by contemporary education. ABOUT THE EDITOR: Daniel McInerny is assistant professor of philosophy at the University of St. Thomas/Center for Thomistic Studies in Houston, Texas. THE CONTRIBUTORS: In addition to the editor, the contributors to the volume are: Benedict M. Ashley, O.P., Romanus Cessario, O.P., Charles Dechert, Donald DeMarco, Curtis L. Hancock, Gregory J.

Cohen, on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The range of the essays, as well as their originality, and their critical and historical depth, pay tribute to the extraordinary scope of Professor Cohen's intellectual interests, as a scientist-philosopher and a humanist, and also to his engagement in the world of social and political practice. The essays presented in Physics, Philosophy, and the Scientific Community (Volume I of Essays in Honor of Robert S. Cohen) focus on philosophical and historical issues in contemporary physics: on the origins and conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, on the reception and understanding of Bohr's and Einstein's work, on the emergence of quantum electrodynamics, and on some of the sharp philosophical and scientific issues that arise in current scientific practice (e.g. in superconductivity research). In addition, several essays deal with critical issues within the philosophy of science, both historical and contemporary: e.g. with Cartesian notions of mechanism in the philosophy of biology; with the language and logic of science - e.g. with new insights concerning the issue of a `physicalistic' language in the arguments of Neurath, Carnap and Wittgenstein; with the notion of `elementary logic'; and with rational and non-rational elements in the history of science.

dwdREAAAQBAJ,Passion and Action,Susan James,Philosophy,1997-10-16,OUP Oxford,,,329,"Passion and Action explores the place of the emotions in seventeenth-century understandings of the body and mind, and the role they were held to play in reasoning and action. Interest in the passions pervaded all areas of philosophical enquiry, and was central to the theories of many major figures, including Hobbes, Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Pascal, and Locke. Yet little attention has been paid to this topic in studies of early modern thought. Susan James surveys the inheritance of ancient and medieval doctrines about the passions, then shows how these were incorporated into new philosophical theories in the course of the seventeenth century. She examines the relation of the emotions to will, knowledge, understanding, desire, and power, offering fresh analyses and interpretations of a broad range of texts by little-known writers as well as canonical figures, and establishing that a full understanding of these authors must take account of their discussions of our affective life. Passion and Action also addresses current debates, particularly those within feminist philosophy, about the embodied character of thinking and the relation between emotion and knowledge. This ground-breaking study throws new light upon the shaping of our ideas about the mind, and provides a historical context for burgeoning contemporary investigations of the emotions.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dwdREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dwdREAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dwdREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=179&source=gbs_api

His literary style is humorous and entertaining, yet the philosophical content is extraordinarily subtle and profound. This book introduces key topics in early Daoist philosophy. Drawing on several issues and methods in Western philosophy, from analytical philosophy to semiotics and hermeneutics, the author throws new light on the ancient Zhuangzi text. Engaging Daoism and contemporary Western philosophical logic, and drawing on new developments in our understanding of early Chinese culture, Coutinho challenges the interpretation of Zhuangzi as either a skeptic or a relativist, and instead seeks to explore his philosophy as emphasizing the ineradicable vagueness of language, thought and reality. This new interpretation of the Zhuangzi offers an important development in the understanding of Daoist philosophy, describing a world in flux in which things themselves are vague and inconsistent, and tries to show us a Way (a Dao) to negotiate through the shadows of a ""chaotic"" world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i99ADgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=i99ADgAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=i99ADgAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=182&source=gbs_api

Scholars have long observed, yet without presenting any transcultural grand theory on the matter, that sacrifice seems to end with (or even continue as) philosophy in both Ancient India and Greece. How are we to understand this important transformation that so profoundly changed the way we think of religion (and philosophy as opposed to religion) today? Some of the complex topics inviting closer examination in this regard are the interiorisation of ritual, ascetism and self-sacrifice, sacrifice and cosmogony, the figure of the philosopher-sage, transformations and technologies of the self, analogical reasoning, the philosophy of ritual, vegetarianism, and metempsychosis.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yoY6rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yoY6rgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yoY6rgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=183&source=gbs_api

G5eOxgEACAAJ,The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Temporal Experience,Ian Phillips,Uncategorized,2019-09-02,Routledge,,,384,"Experience is inescapably temporal. But how do we experience time? Temporal experience is a fundamental subject in philosophy - according to Husserl, the most important and difficult of all. Its puzzles and paradoxes were of critical interest from the Early Moderns through to the Post-Kantians. After a period of relative neglect, temporal experience is again at the forefront of debates across a wealth of areas, from philosophy of mind and psychology, to metaphysics and aesthetics. The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Temporal Experience is an outstanding reference source to the key debates in this exciting subject area and represents the first collection of its kind. Comprising nearly 30 chapters by a team of international contributors, the Handbook is organized into seven clear parts: Ancient and early modern perspectives Nineteenth and early twentieth-century perspectives The structure of temporal experience Temporal experience and the philosophy of mind Temporal experience and metaphysics Empirical perspectives Aesthetics Within each part, key topics concerning temporal experience are examined, including canonical figures such as Locke, Kant and Husserl; extensionalism, retentionalism and the specious present; interrelations between temporal experience and time, agency, dreaming, and the self; empirical theories of perceiving and attending to time; and temporal awareness in the arts including dance, music and film. The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Temporal Experience is essential reading for students and researchers of philosophy of mind and psychology.

9BieAAAAMAAJ,Reasonable Children,Michael S. Pritchard,Education,1996,,,,224,"The public outcry for a return to moral education in our schools has raised more dust than it's dispelled. Building upon his provocative ideas in On Becoming Responsible, Michael Pritchard clears the air with a sensible plan for promoting our children's moral education through the teaching of reasonableness. Pritchard contends that children have a definite but frequently untapped capacity for reasonableness and that schools in a democratic society must make the nurturing of that capacity one of their primary aims, as fundamental to learning as the development of reading, writing, and math skills. Reasonableness itself, he shows, can be best cultivated through the practice of philosophical inquiry within a classroom community. In such an environment, children learn to work together, to listen to one another, to build on one another's ideas, to probe assumptions and different perspectives, and ultimately to think for themselves. Advocating approaches to moral education that avoid mindless indoctrination and timid relativism, Pritchard neither preaches nor hides behind abstractions. He makes liberal use of actual classroom dialogues to illustrate children's remarkable capacity to engage in reasonable conversation about moral concepts involving fairness, cheating, loyalty, truthtelling, lying, making and keeping promises, obedience, character, and responsibility. He also links such discussions to fundamental concerns over law and moral authority, the roles of teachers and parents, and the relationship between church and state. Pritchard draws broadly and deeply from the fields of philosophy and psychology, as well as from his own extensive personal experience working with children and teachers. The result is a rich and insightful work that provides real hope for the future of our children and their moral education.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9BieAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9BieAAAAMAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9BieAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA32&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=201&source=gbs_api
YZw7DwAAQBAJ,"Time, Technology and Environment",Marco Altamirano,Philosophy,2016-02-04,Edinburgh University Press,,,184,"Marco Altamirano critiques the modern concept of nature to chart a new trajectory for the philosophy of nature. He reveals the modern origins of the epistemological configuration of nature, where a subject confronts an object in space (and at time t), and wonders about her mode of access to that object. After critiquing the spatial orientation of this concept of nature, Altamirano shows that a new concept of time is necessary to reinstall the subject within its concrete ecology. Altamirano goes on to deploy conceptual resources excavated from Deleuze, Guattari, Foucault and Leroi-Gourhan to show how technology, which bypasses the nature-artifice distinction, is an essential dimension of the philosophy of nature. Ultimately, this book draws the profile of a concept of nature based on time and technology that escapes the nature-artifice distinction that has mired the philosophy of nature for so long.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YZw7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YZw7DwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YZw7DwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=202&source=gbs_api

After distinguishing things that have value from the value that things might have, it describes the foundations of a pragmatic theory of value. This theory plays a key role in the author’s research on the quality of life and connects his empirical research to the philosophical tradition of the American pragmatists William James, Ralph Barton Perry, John Dewey and Clarence Irving Lewis. The volume addresses various aspects and issues concerning decision making, including decision procedures used in committees, used for assessing the acceptability of scientific theories and new technologies, procedures for a science court, ethical issues involved in the formation of beliefs, some limitations of classical economists’ alleged postulates of rational preference, and the importance of analytic guides to decision making. Finally, it describes the organization of the Social Sciences Federation of Canada and a formal accounting system for scientific research.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_OFKugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_OFKugEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_OFKugEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=203&source=gbs_api

In this book, the authors first provide an introduction to Dewey's educational theories that is founded on a broad and comprehensive reading of his philosophy as a whole. They discuss Dewey's path-breaking contributions by focusing on three important paradigm shifts – namely, the cultural, constructive, and communicative turns in twentieth-century educational thinking. Secondly, the authors recontexualize Dewey for a new generation who has come of age in a very different world than that in which Dewey lived and wrote by connecting his philosophy with six recent and influential discourses (Bauman, Foucault, Bourdieu, Derrida, Levinas, Rorty). These serve as models for other recontexualizations that readers might wish to carry out for themselves.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NLoDX3835NUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NLoDX3835NUC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NLoDX3835NUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api

NdksmAEACAAJ,The Theory of Descriptions,"Graham Stevens, Palgrave Connect (Online Service).",Description (Philosophy),2011,,,,,"Russell's theory of descriptions is one of the most influential contributions made to modern analytical philosophy. It continues to be the subject of contemporary debates in the philosophy of language, and a subject of great historical interest. However, the historical and philosophical treatments of the theory have largely been kept in isolation from one another. The main reason for this has been the universal adoption by historians of an interpretation of Russell as one for whom language was philosophically irrelevant. This book seeks to overturn that interpretation and to present in its place an interpretation of Russell as one for whom the philosophy of language was a central concern. The book defends and extends the theory as a contribution to natural language semantics, while carefully retaining a sensitivity to the historical details of Russell's work, to defend an interpretation of Russell as a pioneering philosopher of language.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NdksmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NdksmAEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NdksmAEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=226&source=gbs_api

In questioning its most fundamental assumptions, they are exposing the inadequacies of theories that ignored gender and the ways in which it shapes experiences and perception. Women, Knowledge and Reality presents the work of twenty-one leading feminist scholars, who explore the breadth and depth of feminist revisions of philosophy. This is the first collection to address the impact of feminist scholarship on methodology, metaphysics, theory of knowledge and their subfields --the philosophies of science, language, mind and religion-- at an introductory level. As an aid to the reader, the editors have organized the chapters by traditional fields of philosophy, and include an introduction to each that contrasts the ideas of feminist thinkers with those of traditional philosophers.

Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, the author examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and his understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and, his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are shown to be of immense importance to the development of French philosophy and the author evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8pjgBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8pjgBQAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8pjgBQAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=243&source=gbs_api

LljMwAEACAAJ,Experimental Philosophy and the Birth of Empirical Science,Michael Ben-Chaim,Science,2004,Routledge,,,222,"Ancient Greek philosophers claimed that the adequate understanding of a particular subject can be achieved only when its nature, or essence, is properly defined. This view furnished the core teachings of late medieval natural philosophers, and was often reaffirmed by early modern philosophers such as Bacon and Descartes. Yet during the second half of the seventeenth century, a radical transformation was to take place that led a to the emergence of a recognisably modern cultures of empirical research.Experimental Philosophy and the Birth of Empirical Science focuses on the works of Robert Boyle, John Locke, and Isaac Newton, the most notable exponents of the experimental philosophy in the late seventeenth century, and explores this transformation to a modern viewpoint that seeks to understand phenomena by seeking explanatory correlations between the empirical properties of the universe.Experimental Philosophy and the Birth of Empirical Science offers a novel solution to one of the major problems in the history of early modern science and philosophy, while addressing received views concerning these problems. It provides a new perspective on the Scientific Revolution and the rise of modern science and offers new tools for science studies in general, by showing how the problem of human understanding and the problem of explanation are central to the evolution of science, and how we can combine historical and sociological approaches to study modern science from this perspective.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LljMwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LljMwAEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LljMwAEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=248&source=gbs_api

drD1vwEACAAJ,A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence,"Enrico Pattaro, Corrado Roversi",Philosophy,2020-08-14,Springer,,,0,"A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence is the first-ever multivolume treatment of the issues in legal philosophy and general jurisprudence, from both a theoretical and a historical perspective. The work is aimed at jurists as well as legal and practical philosophers. Edited by the renowned theorist Enrico Pattaro and his team, this book is a classical reference work that would be of great interest to legal and practical philosophers as well as to jurists and legal scholar at all levels. The work is divided in two parts. The theoretical part (published in 2005), consisting of five volumes, covers the main topics of the contemporary debate; the historical part, consisting of six volumes (Volumes 6-8 published in 2007; Volumes 9 and 10, published in 2009; Volume 11 published in 2011 and Volume 12 forthcoming in 2016), accounts for the development of legal thought from ancient Greek times through the twentieth century. Volume 12 Legal Philosophy in the Twentieth Century: The Civil Law World Volume 12 of A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence, titled Legal Philosophy in the Twentieth Century: The Civil-Law World, functions as a complement to Gerald Postema’s volume 11 (titled Legal Philosophy in the Twentieth Century: The Common Law World), and it offers the first comprehensive account of the complex development that legal philosophy has undergone in continental Europe and Latin America since 1900. In this volume, leading international scholars from the different language areas making up the civil-law world give an account of the way legal philosophy has evolved in these areas in the 20th century, the outcome being an overall mosaic of civil-law legal philosophy in this arc of time. Further, specialists in the field describe the development that legal philosophy has undergone in the 20th century by focusing on three of its main subjects—namely, legal positivism, natural-law theory, and the theory of legal reasoning—and discussing the different conceptions that have been put forward under these labels. The layout of the volume is meant to frame historical analysis with a view to the contemporary theoretical debate, thus completing the Treatise in keeping with its overall methodological aim, namely, that of combining history and theory as a necessary means by which to provide a comprehensive account of jurisprudential thinking.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=drD1vwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=drD1vwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=drD1vwEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=252&source=gbs_api

It is characterized by the overarching importance of the human species in a number of respects, but also by the recognition of human dependence and precariousness. A critical human turn affecting the human condition is still in the process of arriving in the wake of an initial Copernican Revolution and Kant's ensuing second Copernican Counter-revolution. Within this landscape, issues concerning the human - its finitude, responsiveness, responsibility, maturity, auto-affection and relationship to itself - appear rephrased and re-accentuated as decisive probing questions. In this book Sverre Raffnsøe explores how the change has ramifications for the kinds of knowledge that can be acquired concerning human beings and for the human sciences as a study of human existential beings in the world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qmp9jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Qmp9jgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Qmp9jgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=255&source=gbs_api
N2Vza6cjAAQC,Issues in Contemporary Philosophy of Religion,Eugene Thomas Long,Philosophy,2001-11-30,Springer Science & Business Media,,,228,"This collection of original articles, written by leading contemporary European and American philosophers of religion, is presented in celebration of the publication of the fiftieth volume of the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion. Following the Editor's Introduction, John Macquarrie, Adriaan Peperzak, and Hent de Vries take up central themes in continental philosophy of religion. Macquarrie analyzes postmodernism and its influence in philosophy and theology. Peperzak argues for a form of universality different from that of modern philosophy, and de Vries analyzes an intrinsic and structural relationship between religion and the media. The next three essays discuss issues in analytic philosophy of religion. Philip Quinn argues that religious diversity reduces the epistemic status of exclusivism and makes it possible for a religious person to be justified while living within a pluralistic environment. William Wainwright plumbs the work of Jonathan Edwards in order to better understand debates concerning freedom, determinism, and the problem of evil, and William Hasker asks whether theological incompatibilism is less inimical to traditional theism than some have supposed. Representing the Thomist tradition, Fergus Kerr challenges standard readings of Aquinas on the arguments for the existence of God. David Griffin analyzes the contributions of process philosophy to the problem of evil and the relation between science and religion. Illustrating comparative approaches, Keith Ward argues that the Semitic and Indian traditions have developed a similar concept of God that should be revised in view of post-Enlightenment theories of the individual and the historical. Keith Yandell explores themes in the Indian metaphysical tradition and considers what account of persons is most in accord with reincarnation and karma doctrines. Feminist philosophy of religion is represented in Pamela Anderson's article, in which she argues for a gender-sensitive and more inclusive approach to the craving for infinitude.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2Vza6cjAAQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N2Vza6cjAAQC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N2Vza6cjAAQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=256&source=gbs_api

They emphasize that this book is not a project in comparative philosophy, nor is it geared towards making Africa/ns the object/subjects of philosophy.

In doing so, it builds a bridge between the East and West and advances a dialogue in the philosophy of engineering. Divided into three parts, the book starts with studies on epistemological and ontological issues, with a special focus on engineering design, creativity, management, feasibility, and sustainability. Part II considers relationships between the history and philosophy of engineering, and includes a general argument for the necessity of dialogue between history and philosophy. It continues with a general introduction to traditional Chinese attitudes toward engineering and technology, and philosophical case studies of the Chinese steel industry, railroads, and cybernetics in the Soviet Union. Part III focuses on engineering, ethics, and society, with chapters on engineering education and practice in China and the West. The book’s analyses of the interactions of science, engineering, ethics, politics, and policy in different societal contexts are of special interest. The volume as a whole marks a new stage in the emergence of the philosophy of engineering as a new regionalization of philosophy.

To present the study in a reader-friendly format, it has been divided into two parts, with the first volume (Part 6) dedicated to the 'history' of science and the second volume (Part 7) to the 'philosophy' of science. The first volume, History of Science and Philosophy of Science: A Historical Perspective of the Evolution of Ideas in Science, seeks to present a history of science where science is believed to proceed along with the operation of a number of mechanisms that are instrumental to its growth, thus making science a part of a creative culture. This part works out the relation not between history and the history of science, but between science and the history of science. Though the volume focuses mainly on physics and mathematics, it also includes essays on life sciences and consciousness studies. The order of essays is guided not by chronology but by a philosophical interpretation of the development of major reforms and revisions in the field of science both in India and abroad. Some authors have paid full attention to Indian science and its logic, while some others have preferred to deal with Western science. Presented in a fairly non-technical language and readily accessible even to non-specialists, these volumes will be of interest to researchers and well-informed general readers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIC6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FIC6DwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FIC6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=264&source=gbs_api

UfNcCAAAQBAJ,The Magic Prism,Howard Wettstein,Philosophy,2004-04-01,Oxford University Press,,,254,"The late 20th century saw great movement in the philosophy of language, often critical of the fathers of the subject--Gottlieb Frege and Bertrand Russell--but sometimes supportive of (or even defensive about) the work of the fathers. Howard Wettstein's sympathies lie with the critics. But he says that they have often misconceived their critical project, treating it in ways that are technically focused and that miss the deeper implications of their revolutionary challenge. Wettstein argues that Wittgenstein--a figure with whom the critics of Frege and Russell are typically unsympathetic--laid the foundation for much of what is really revolutionary in this late 20th century movement. The subject itself should be of great interest, since philosophy of language has functioned as a kind of foundation for much of 20th century philosophy. But in fact it remains a subject for specialists, since the ideas are difficult and the mode of presentation is often fairly technical. In this book, Wettstein brings the non-specialist into the conversation (especially in early chapters); he also reconceives the debate in a way that avoids technical formulation. The Magic Prism is intended for professional philosophers, graduate students, and upper division undergraduates.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UfNcCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UfNcCAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UfNcCAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=269&source=gbs_api

It investigates Jean-Luc Nancy's reading of Heidegger, focusing on the question of Being-with, and starting with the problem of otherness in Heidegger, the book goes on to establish a dialogue between Nancy and the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. With intellectual agility and command of cinema, literature and visual art, Daniele Rugo insists on the critical significance of Nancy's project for any future philosophy attempting to define itself beyond foundational acts, and according to the continuous crossings at the heart of existence. By discussing Nancy alongside Heidegger and Levinas, Rugo underlines the essential indecision between philosophy-as-literature and philosophy as the re-appropriation of the question of Being. Rugo offers unexpected associations which return thinking to the play of specificity, rather than restricting it to the passage of abstract formulations.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q5qAFtrya6kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=q5qAFtrya6kC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=q5qAFtrya6kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=271&source=gbs_api

Obiedat,Religion,2023-07-23,Palgrave Macmillan,,,0,"This is the first study to compare the philosophical systems of secular scientific philosopher Mario Bunge (1919-2020), and Moroccan Islamic philosopher Taha Abd al-Rahman (b.1945). In their efforts to establish the philosophical underpinnings of an ideal modernity these two great thinkers speak to the same elements of the human condition, despite their opposing secular and religious worldviews. While the differences between Bunge’s critical-realist epistemology and materialist ontology on the one hand, and Taha’s spiritualist ontology and revelational-mystical epistemology on the other, are fundamental, there is remarkable common ground between their scientific and Islamic versions of humanism. Both call for an ethics of prosperity combined with social justice, and both criticize postmodernism and religious conservatism. The aspiration of this book is to serve as a model for future dialogue between holders of Western and Islamic worldviews, in mutual pursuit of modernity’s best-case scenario.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yUQD0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yUQD0AEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yUQD0AEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=272&source=gbs_api

QEzAzgEACAAJ,Law and the Philosophy of Language,Pascal Richard,Jurisprudence,2021,Routledge,,,0,"Academic legal production, when it focuses on the study of law, generally grasps this concept on the basis of a reference to positive law and its practice. This book differs clearly from these analyses and integrates the legal approach into the philosophy of normative language, philosophical realism and pragmatism. The aim is not only to place the examination of law in the immanence of its practice, but also to take note of the fact that legal enunciation must be taken seriously. In order to arrive at this analysis, it is necessary to go beyond traditional perspectives and to base reflection on an investigation of the conditions for enunciating law in our democracies. This analysis thus offers a renewal of the ethics inherent in the action of jurists and an original reflection on the role of certain legal tools such as concepts, categories, or provisions. In this sense, the work nourishes its originality not only by the transversality of its approach, but also by the will to situate legal thought in concrete forms of its implementation. The book will be essential reading for academics working in the areas of legal theory, legal philosophy and constitutional theory.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEzAzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QEzAzgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QEzAzgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=280&source=gbs_api

Philosophy of Science: An Historical Anthology combines excerpts from key historical writings with insightful commentary to provide a text that distinctively follows strands of scientific inquiry, investigation, and debate for the past 2,500 years. Beginning with the Ancient Greeks, Part I examines the roots of ancient and medieval philosophy of science before proceeding to the scientific revolution, with extensive coverage of such scientists as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton as well as modern philosophers including Descartes, Hume, and Kant. Part II covers philosophy of science in the 20th century, first laying out the fundamental doctrines of the highly influential logical positivist movement and the emergence of its ""received view"" of scientific theories. It then traces the challenges to the received view and the impact of those challenges on issues in contemporary philosophy of science such as confirmation and observation, methodology, and realism.

Quality translations are accompanied by an editors' introduction and annotations. Boris Hessen is known in history of science circles for his “Social and Economic Roots of Newton’s Principia” presented in London (1931), which inspired new approaches in the West. As a philosopher and a physicist, he was tasked with developing a Marxist approach to science in the 1920s. He studied the history of physics to clarify issues such as reductionism and causality as they applied to new developments. With the philosophers called the “Dialecticians”, his debates with the opposing “Mechanists” on the issue of emergence are still worth studying and largely ignored in the many recent works on this subject.

3U4FuhDsxukC,Relationscapes,Erin Manning,Movement (Philosophy),2009,MIT Press,,,279,"With Relationscapes, Erin Manning offers a new philosophy of movement challenging the idea that movement is simple displacement in space, knowable only in terms of the actual. Exploring the relation between sensation and thought through the prisms of dance, cinema, art, and new media, Manning argues for the intensity of movement. From this idea of intensity -- the incipiency at the heart of movement -- Manning develops the concept of preacceleration, which makes palpable how movement creates relational intervals out of which displacements take form. Discussing her theory of incipient movement in terms of dance and relational movement, Manning describes choreographic practices that work to develop with a body in movement rather than simply stabilizing that body into patterns of displacement. She examines the movement-images of Leni Riefenstahl, �tienne-Jules Marey, and Norman McLaren (drawing on Bergson's idea of duration), and explores the dot-paintings of contemporary Australian Aboriginal artists. Turning to language, Manning proposes a theory of prearticulation claiming that language's affective force depends on a concept of thought in motion. Relationscapes takes a ""Whiteheadian perspective,"" recognizing Whitehead's importance and his influence on process philosophers of the late twentieth century -- Deleuze and Guattari in particular. It will be of special interest to scholars in new media, philosophy, dance studies, film theory, and art history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3U4FuhDsxukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3U4FuhDsxukC&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3U4FuhDsxukC&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=292&source=gbs_api

Sartre tries to convey some of his philosophical concerns through this novel. Although the philosophical ideas are conveyed in the novel these are not as vivid as could be in a philosophical texts (The Transcendence of the Ego 1936, Being and Nothingness 1943). The significance of this work, however, lies not on understanding the philosophical concerns in isolation, but in employing the same in the form of a literary work and certain literary technique in pseudonymous plays or names. Sartre engages with pseudonymous play of protagonist and many other characters in his semi-autobiographical novel Nausea as he also says by himself in his later publication of autobiographical work The Words (1946) and first undated sheets of the novel Nausea where he laments his constant confrontation with difficult situations of lived experience.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=viVtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=viVtEAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=viVtEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=293&source=gbs_api

Waelbers",Computers,2008-06-20,IOS Press,,,216,"The theme of this volume is the multi-faceted ‘computational turn’ that is occurring through the interaction of the disciplines of philosophy and computing. In computer and information sciences, there are significant conceptual and methodological questions that require reflection and analysis. Moreover, digital, information and communication technologies have had tremendous impact on society, which raises further philosophical questions. This book tries to facilitate the task to continuously work to ensure that its diversity of perspectives and methods proves a source of strength and collaboration rather than a source of instability and disintegration. The first three contributions explore the phenomenon of virtual worlds. The next four focus on robots and artificial agents. Then a group of chapters discusses the relation between human mentality and information processing in computers and the final section covers a broad range of issues at the interface of computers and society.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8A7vAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8A7vAgAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8A7vAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=301&source=gbs_api

In addition, Waismann's original papers in ethics, metaphysics, epistemology and the philosophy of mathematics are here evaluated. They introduce Waismann's theory of action along with his groundbreaking work on fiction, proper names and Kafka's Trial. Waismann is known as the voice of Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Vienna Circle. At the same time we find in his works a determined critic of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy, who anticipated much later developments in the analytic tradition and devised his very own vision for its future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F1ogxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=F1ogxgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=F1ogxgEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=302&source=gbs_api

9i1zDwAAQBAJ,Racism and Philosophy,"Susan E. Babbitt, Sue Campbell",Philosophy,2018-10-18,Cornell University Press,,,304,"By definitively establishing that racism has broad implications for how the entire field of philosophy is practiced—and by whom—this powerful and convincing book puts all members of the discipline on notice that racism concerns them. It simultaneously demonstrates to race theorists the significance of philosophy for their work.A distinguished cast of authors takes a stand on the importance of race, focusing on the insights that analyses of race and racism can make to philosophy—not just to ethics and political philosophy but also to the more abstract debates of metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and epistemology. Contemporary philosophy, the authors argue, continues to evade racism and, as a result, often helps to promote it. At the same time, anti-racist theorists in many disciplines regularly draw on crucial notions of objectivity, rationality, agency, individualism, and truth without adequate knowledge of philosophical analyses of these very concepts. Racism and Philosophy demonstrates the impossibility of talking thoughtfully about race without recourse to philosophy. Written to engage readers with a wide variety of interests, this is an essential book for all theorists of race and for all philosophers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9i1zDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9i1zDwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9i1zDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=304&source=gbs_api

Sex-AgAAQBAJ,Philosophy of Language and the Challenge to Scientific Realism,Christopher Norris,Language Arts & Disciplines,2004-06-02,Routledge,,,216,"In this book Christopher Norris develops the case for scientific realism by tackling various adversary arguments from a range of anti-realist positions. Through a close critical reading he shows how they fail to make adequate sense on any rational, consistent, and scientifically-informed survey of the evidence. Along the way he incorporates a number of detailed case-studies from the history and philosophy of science. Norris devotes much of his discussion to some of the most prominent and widely influential source-texts of anti-realism. Also included are the sophisticated versions of verificationism developed - albeit in very different ways - by thinkers such as Michael Dummett and Bas van Fraassen. Central to Norris's argument is a prolonged engagement with the once highly influential but nowadays neglected work of Norwood Russell Hanson. This book will be welcomed especially by readers who possess some knowledge of the background debate and who wish to deepen and extend their understanding of these issues beyond an introductory level.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sex-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Sex-AgAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Sex-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=309&source=gbs_api

Up until now, however, computer games have received relatively little attention from philosophy. Seeking to remedy this, the present collection of newly written papers by philosophers and media researchers addresses a range of philosophical questions related to three issues of crucial importance for understanding the phenomenon of computer games: the nature of gameplay and player experience, the moral evaluability of player and avatar actions, and the reality status of the gaming environment. By doing so, the book aims to establish the philosophy of computer games as an important strand of computer games research, and as a separate field of philosophical inquiry. The book is required reading for anyone with an academic or professional interest in computer games, and will also be of value to readers curious about the philosophical issues raised by contemporary digital culture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HrvnoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HrvnoQEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HrvnoQEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=328&source=gbs_api

WPc9NF9AB-MC,Atheism Explained,David Ramsay Steele,Religion,2008-02-01,Open Court,,,341,"Atheism Explained explores the claims made both for and against the existence of God. On the pro side: that the wonders of the world can only be explained by an intelligent creator; that the universe had to start somewhere; telepathy, out-of-body experiences, and other paranormal phenomena demonstrate the existence of a spirit world; and that those who experience God directly provide evidence as real as any physical finding. After disputing these arguments through calm, careful criticism, author David Ramsay Steele presents the reasons why God cannot exist: monstrous, appalling evils; the impossibility of omniscience; and the senseless concept that God is a thinking mind without a brain.

2nSRAQAACAAJ,"Philosophy of Love, Sex, and Marriage",Raja Halwani,Love,2018,,,,423,"How is love different from lust or infatuation? Do love and marriage really go together ""like a horse and carriage""? Does sex have any necessary connection to either? And how important are love, sex, and marriage to a well-lived life? In the Second Edition of this lively, lucid, and comprehensive book, Raja Halwani explores and elucidates the nature, uses, and ethics of romantic love, sexuality, and marriage. It is structured in three parts: Love examines the nature of romantic love and how it differs from other types of love, such as friendship and parental love. It also investigates the relationship of love to morality and asks what limits morality puts on romantic love and even whether romantic love is inherently moral. Sex demonstrates the difficulty in defining sex and the sexual, and examines what constitutes good and bad sex in terms of pleasure, ""naturalness,"" and moral permissibility. It discusses the nature of sexual desire and its connection to objectification and virtue, all the while looking at specific sexual engagements such as pornography, BDSM, and raced desires. Marriage traces the history of the institution and describes the various forms in which marriage exists and the reasons why people marry. It also investigates the necessity of marriage and ways in which it requires reform. Updates and Revisions in the Second Edition Expands the coverage of love and morality from one to two chapters, incorporating much of the recent literature on love as a moral emotion. Includes a new chapter on sex and virtue ethics. Ends each of the chapters on sex with an ""applied"" topic, such as pornography, BDSM, prostitution, racial sexual desires, and adultery. Increases coverage of the nature and purpose of marriage, including debates surrounding same-sex marriage, but also moving beyond these debates to include issues on minimal marriage, temporary marriage, polygamy, and other forms of marriage. Updates the Further Reading and Study Questions sections at the end of each chapter and provides an up-to-date comprehensive bibliography at the back of the book. Includes new discussions of topics on the nature of love; love and reasons; distinctions between two types of romantic love; love and its connections to moral theories; definitions of crucial sexual concepts; objectification; virtue and sex; racial sexual desires; and the definition of marriage and whether it is important as an institution.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2nSRAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2nSRAQAACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2nSRAQAACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=340&source=gbs_api

This second volume of the Educational Philosophy and Theory reader series demonstrates the continuing relevance of philosophical approaches to the field of teacher education. The collection of texts focuses on a wide range of topics, including teacher education in a cross-cultural context, the notion of unsuccessful teaching, democratic teacher education, the reflective teacher, the ethics and politics of teacher identity, and subjectivity and performance in teaching. Chapters also explore teacher education based on experiential learning as 'experience', demonstrating the continuing relevance of philosophical approaches to the field. In Search of Subjectivities will interest academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of philosophy of education, philosophy, education, educational theory, teacher education, experiential philosophy, ethics, policy and politics of education, and professional practice.",,http://books.google.com/books?id=PVhfnQAACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PVhfnQAACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=342&source=gbs_api

xI1SEAAAQBAJ,Utopophobia,David Estlund,Philosophy,2022-05-31,Princeton University Press,,,398,"A leading political theorist’s groundbreaking defense of ideal conceptions of justice in political philosophy Throughout the history of political philosophy and politics, there has been continual debate about the roles of idealism versus realism. For contemporary political philosophy, this debate manifests in notions of ideal theory versus nonideal theory. Nonideal thinkers shift their focus from theorizing about full social justice, asking instead which feasible institutional and political changes would make a society more just. Ideal thinkers, on the other hand, question whether full justice is a standard that any society is likely ever to satisfy. And, if social justice is unrealistic, are attempts to understand it without value or importance, and merely utopian? Utopophobia argues against thinking that justice must be realistic, or that understanding justice is only valuable if it can be realized. David Estlund does not offer a particular theory of justice, nor does he assert that justice is indeed unrealizable—only that it could be, and this possibility upsets common ways of proceeding in political thought. Estlund engages critically with important strands in traditional and contemporary political philosophy that assume a sound theory of justice has the overriding, defining task of contributing practical guidance toward greater social justice. Along the way, he counters several tempting perspectives, including the view that inquiry in political philosophy could have significant value only as a guide to practical political action, and that understanding true justice would necessarily have practical value, at least as an ideal arrangement to be approximated. Demonstrating that unrealistic standards of justice can be both sound and valuable to understand, Utopophobia stands as a trenchant defense of ideal theory in political philosophy.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xI1SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xI1SEAAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xI1SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=345&source=gbs_api

ALEKSANDR BOGDANOV On April 7, 1928 the career of one of the most extraordinary figures of Russian and early Soviet intellectual life came to an abrupt and premature end. In the process of an experiment on blood transfusion, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Malinovsky, better known as Bogdanov, had exchanged his blood with that of a critically ill malaria victim in hopes of saving both the patient and his blood. The outcome of this may be guessed: both doctor and patient died forthwith. ! Although an extraordinary venture on Bogdanov's part, for it was part of a search for the means to immortality,2 the transfusion experiment was only one of a host of startling things he had done in his thirty years in Russian politics and public life. In actuality, the activities and achievement of his two years as director of the Soviet Union's first institute for the study of blood transfusion seem virtually insignificant beside the events of earlier years. 3 It would be fair to say that Aleksandr Bogdanov stood in a singularly prominent position in the political and intellectual life of Russia from the turn of the century to 1930. Politically, he had been Lenin's only serious rival for leadership among the Bolsheviks before 1917. In the early years of the Soviet regime, Bogdanov stood head and shoulders above any other public figure operating outside the ranks of the Party.

At the same time, politics seems increasingly impotent in the face of these threats. In this book, the leading Italian philosopher Roberto Esposito reconstructs the genealogy of the reciprocal intertwining of politics and negation. He retraces the intensification of negation in the thought of various thinkers, from Schmitt and Freud to Heidegger, and examines the negative slant of some of our fundamental political categories, such as sovereignty, property and freedom. Against the centrality of negation, Esposito proposes an affirmative philosophy that does not negate or repress negation but radically rethinks it in the positive cipher of difference, determination and opposition. The result is a rigorous and original pathway which, in the tension between affirmation and negation, recognizes the disturbing traumas of our time, as well as the harbingers of what awaits at its limits. This highly original and timely book will be of great value to students and scholars in philosophy, cultural theory and the humanities more generally, and to anyone interested in contemporary European thought.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Na5AxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Na5AxQEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Na5AxQEACAAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=352&source=gbs_api

The debates revolve mainly around two issues: firstly, whether social phenomena exist sui generis and how they relate to individuals. This is the focus of discussions between ontological individualists and ontological holists. Secondly, to what extent social scientific explanations may and should, focus on individuals and social phenomena respectively. This issue is debated amongst methodological holists and methodological individualists. In social science and philosophy, both issues have been intensively discussed and new versions of the dispute have appeared just as new arguments have been advanced. At present, the individualism/holism debate is extremely lively and this book reflects the major positions and perspectives within the debate. This volume is also relevant to debates about two closely related issues in social science: the micro-macro debate and the agency-structure debate. This book presents contributions from key figures in both social science and philosophy, in the first such collection on this topic to be published since the 1970s.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EfO_AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EfO_AwAAQBAJ&dq=philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EfO_AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=philosophy&hl=&cd=357&source=gbs_api

abqjP-_KfzkC,The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science,John L. Heilbron,Science,2003-02-14,Oxford University Press,,,994,"Containing 609 encyclopedic articles written by more than 200 prominent scholars, The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science presents an unparalleled history of the field invaluable to anyone with an interest in the technology, ideas, discoveries, and learned institutions that have shaped our world over the past five centuries. Focusing on the period from the Renaissance to the early twenty-first century, the articles cover all disciplines (Biology, Alchemy, Behaviorism), historical periods (the Scientific Revolution, World War II, the Cold War), concepts (Hypothesis, Space and Time, Ether), and methodologies and philosophies (Observation and Experiment, Darwinism). Coverage is international, tracing the spread of science from its traditional centers and explaining how the prevailing knowledge of non-Western societies has modified or contributed to the dominant global science as it is currently understood. Revealing the interplay between science and the wider culture, the Companion includes entries on topics such as minority groups, art, religion, and science's practical applications. One hundred biographies of the most iconic historic figures, chosen for their contributions to science and the interest of their lives, are also included. Above all The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science is a companion to world history: modern in coverage, generous in breadth, and cosmopolitan in scope. The volume's utility is enhanced by a thematic outline of the entire contents, a thorough system of cross-referencing, and a detailed index that enables the reader to follow a specific line of inquiry along various threads from multiple starting points. Each essay has numerous suggestions for further reading, all of which favor literature that is accessible to the general reader, and a bibliographical essay provides a general overview of the scholarship in the field. Lastly, as a contribution to the visual appeal of the Companion, over 100 black-and-white illustrations and an eight-page color section capture the eye and spark the imagination.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=abqjP-_KfzkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=abqjP-_KfzkC&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=abqjP-_KfzkC&pg=PA738&dq=science&hl=&cd=302&source=gbs_api

Here the reader learns why there is any debate at all and what resources exist for responding to it. The second half deals with specific issues that arise in the individual sciences, from astronomy and physics to biology and ecology. Any project hoping to connect science and religion must supply the categories of connection, which are found primarily, although not exclusively, in philosophy. The simplicity of the arrangement and the nature of the selections are intended to make 'Religion and the Natural Sciences' available to as wide an audience as possible, including students from the sciences and technology, the professions, the humanities and liberal studies, and theology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k0pLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=k0pLAwAAQBAJ&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=k0pLAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA51&dq=science&hl=&cd=319&source=gbs_api

p0fODwAAQBAJ,Thomas Seebohm on the Foundations of the Sciences,Thomas Nenon,Philosophy,2020-02-03,Springer Nature,,,245,"This book explores the work of Thomas Seebohm (1934-2014), a leading phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. It features papers that offer a critical and constructive dialogue about Seebohm’s analyses and their implications for the sciences. The net result is an in-depth study and a helpful overview of Seebohm’s general approach and his specific views on various areas of modern science. The contributors focus especially upon his final text, History as a Science and the System of the Sciences. They view this as the culmination and summary of his historical and phenomenological investigations into the foundations, nature, and limits of modern sciences. This includes not just history but the Geisteswissenschaften more generally, along with the social and natural sciences as well. The essays in this volume reflect that range. This volume presents insightful discussions about the nature and legitimacy of the human sciences as sciences and the unique character of the social sciences. It will be of interest not just as a matter of historical scholarship, but also and above all as an important contribution to phenomenology and to the philosophy of science and the sciences as such. It deserves attention by scholars from any philosophical tradition interested in thinking about the foundations of their disciplines and a philosophy of science that includes, but is not limited to, the natural sciences.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p0fODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=p0fODwAAQBAJ&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=p0fODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=science&hl=&cd=336&source=gbs_api

It explores the profound revolution in the way of thinking, and in particular the successful refutation of the school of thought inherited from the Greeks, which focused on the perfection and immutability of the celestial world. In addition, the emergence of the scientific method and the adoption of mathematics as the central tool in scientific endeavors are discussed. The book then explores the delicate thread between pure philosophy, grand unifying theories, and verifiable real-life scientific facts. Lastly, it turns to Kepler’s crucial 3rd law and shows how it was derived from a mere six data points, corresponding to the six planets known at the time.

2USt8izY69AC,Understanding Philosophy of Science,James Ladyman,Philosophy,2012-08-06,Routledge,,,312,"Few can imagine a world without telephones or televisions; many depend on computers and the Internet as part of daily life. Without scientific theory, these developments would not have been possible. In this exceptionally clear and engaging introduction to philosophy of science, James Ladyman explores the philosophical questions that arise when we reflect on the nature of the scientific method and the knowledge it produces. He discusses whether fundamental philosophical questions about knowledge and reality might be answered by science, and considers in detail the debate between realists and antirealists about the extent of scientific knowledge. Along the way, central topics in philosophy of science, such as the demarcation of science from non-science, induction, confirmation and falsification, the relationship between theory and observation and relativism are all addressed. Important and complex current debates over underdetermination, inference to the best explaination and the implications of radical theory change are clarified and clearly explained for those new to the subject.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2USt8izY69AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2USt8izY69AC&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2USt8izY69AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science&hl=&cd=391&source=gbs_api

JKuTEAAAQBAJ,"Science, Society, and the Search for Life in the Universe",Bruce M. Jakosky,Science,2006-10-26,University of Arizona Press,,,162,"Are we alone in the universe? As humans, are we unique or are we part of a greater cosmic existence? What is lifeÕs future on Earth and beyond? How does life begin and develop? These are age-old questions that have inspired wonder and controversy ever since the first people looked up into the sky. With todayÕs technology, however, we are closer than ever to finding the answers. Astrobiology is the relatively new, but fast growing scientific discipline that involves trying to understand the origin, evolution, and distribution of life within the universe. It is also one of the few scientific disciplines that attracts the publicÕs intense curiosity and attention. This interest stems largely from the deep personal meaning that the possible existence of extraterrestrial life has for so many. Whether this meaning relates to addressing the ÒBig QuestionsÓ of our existence, the possibility of encountering life on other planets, or the potential impact on our understanding of religion, there is no doubt that the public is firmly vested in finding answers. In this broadly accessible introduction to the field, Bruce Jakosky looks at the search for life in the universe not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a distinctly social one. In lucid and engaging prose, he addresses topics including the contradiction between the publicÕs fascination and the meager dialogue that exists between those within the scientific community and those outside of it, and what has become some of the most impassioned political wrangling ever seen in government science funding.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JKuTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JKuTEAAAQBAJ&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JKuTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science&hl=&cd=394&source=gbs_api

FIC6DwAAQBAJ,History of Science and Philosophy of Science: A Historical Perspective of the Evolution of Ideas in Science,Sengupta,Uncategorized,,Pearson Education India,,,777,"History of Science and Philosophy of Science, a primarily interdisciplinary study, deals with the historical and philosophical perspectives of science and explores the mutuality of the relations between the two disciplines. To present the study in a reader-friendly format, it has been divided into two parts, with the first volume (Part 6) dedicated to the 'history' of science and the second volume (Part 7) to the 'philosophy' of science. The first volume, History of Science and Philosophy of Science: A Historical Perspective of the Evolution of Ideas in Science, seeks to present a history of science where science is believed to proceed along with the operation of a number of mechanisms that are instrumental to its growth, thus making science a part of a creative culture. This part works out the relation not between history and the history of science, but between science and the history of science. Though the volume focuses mainly on physics and mathematics, it also includes essays on life sciences and consciousness studies. The order of essays is guided not by chronology but by a philosophical interpretation of the development of major reforms and revisions in the field of science both in India and abroad. Some authors have paid full attention to Indian science and its logic, while some others have preferred to deal with Western science. Presented in a fairly non-technical language and readily accessible even to non-specialists, these volumes will be of interest to researchers and well-informed general readers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIC6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FIC6DwAAQBAJ&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FIC6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science&hl=&cd=405&source=gbs_api

wx5nam-r96EC,Science In Society,Massimiano Bucchi,Science,2004-07-31,Routledge,,,169,"The world around us is continually being shaped by science, and by society’s relationship to it. In recent years sociologists have been increasingly preoccupied with the latter, and now in this fascinating book, Massimiano Bucchi provides a brief introduction to this topical issue. Bucchi provides clear and unassuming summaries of all the major theoretical positions within the sociology of science, illustrated with many fascinating examples. Theories covered include Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific change, the sociology of scientific knowledge, actor-network theory, and the social construction of technology. The second half of the book looks at recent public controversies over the role of science in the modern world including: * the Sokal affair, otherwise known as the science wars * debates over public understanding of science, such as global warming and genetically modified food * the implications of the human genome project. This much needed introduction to a rapidly growing area brings theory alive and will be essential reading for all students of the sociology of science.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wx5nam-r96EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wx5nam-r96EC&dq=science&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wx5nam-r96EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science&hl=&cd=414&source=gbs_api

lV7hBwAAQBAJ,Clinical Psychology,C. Eugene Walker,Psychology,2013-11-21,Springer Science & Business Media,,,536,"The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with a survey of some of the major areas of clinical psychology. No attempt has been made to include every area relevant to clinical psychology; the choices are selective but represent the wide range of areas touched by clinical psychologists. For some years I have felt the need for a book that provides students with more of a historical introduction and context from which to view current clinical psychology than is included in most textbooks. The issues and problems of clinical psychology have been with us since the beginning of time; however, most psychological literature is written with the bias that anything older than five or ten years is not relevant. Those who attempt to take a long-range view of clinical psychology are sometimes able to recall the early development of the field in the 1930s and 1940s. In this text, I asked the authors to begin with a brief survey of ancient and medieval history to set the stage for a discussion of current research and developments in the field. I hope that a presentation of this sort will provide the reader-whether advanced undergraduate, graduate, or professional-with a sense of perspective and context from which to view and understand clinical psychology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lV7hBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lV7hBwAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lV7hBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api

These early roots can mislead the casual observer about the history of psychology and law. Vigorous and sustained research in the field is a recent phenomenon. It is only 15 years since the first review of psy chology and law appeared in the Annual Review of Psychology (Tapp, 1976). The following year saw the first issue of Law and Human Behavior, the official publication of the American Psychology-Law Society and now the journal of the American Psychological Associ ation's Division of Psychology and Law. Few psychology departments offered even a single course in psychology and law before 1973, while by 1982 1/4 of psychology graduate programs had at least one course, and a number had begun to offer forensic minors and/or joint J. D. / Ph. D. programs (Freeman & Roesch, see Chapter 28). Yet this short period of less than 20 years has seen a dramatic level of activity. Its strengths and weaknesses, excitements and disappointments, are aII captured in the collection of chapters published in this first Handbook of Psychology and Law.

Rooted in semiotic cultural psychology and guided by the GTPI framework, this book offers a cohesive perspective of psychology, addressing the prevailing fragmentation evident in various domains of psychology such as health, sports, forensic, organisational, and clinical psychology. The framework establishes a foundation of methods and techniques that render psychological interventions applicable across various domains, substantiated by concrete examples from different areas. With chapters revolving around theories of action, change and the client dynamics, this groundbreaking work provides both a conceptual and methodological structure to underpin domain-specific theories and methodologies, thereby strengthening the conceptual links among distinct domains of psychology. As one of the first works to develop a theory and method of intervention across multiple psychological domains, this book will be of interest to postgraduate students and researchers specialising in cultural psychology, clinical psychology, health psychology, and the philosophy of psychology.

A main driver of human thought, emotion, and action? Absolutely--and psychology and its related fields are getting closer to understanding its complex role in human behavior and in society. The Psychological Science of Money brings together classic and current findings on the myriad ways money affects brain, mind, and behavior to satisfy not only our needs for material gain, but also for autonomy and self-worth. Leading experts trace the links between early concepts of value and modern symbolic meanings of wealth, in addition to identifying the areas of the human brain that together act as its financial center. This cross-disciplinary analysis helps clarify the neuroscience behind pathological gambling, the critical role of time in financial decisions, and the impact of money on diverse personal activities and interpersonal relationships. Included in the coverage: Materiality, symbol, and complexity in the anthropology of money. The (relative and absolute) subjective value of money. Conscious and unconscious influences of money: two sides of the same coin? A life-course approach to dealing with monetary gains and losses Motivation and cognitive control: beyond monetary incentives. An integrative perspective on the science of getting paid.

Palmer The materials translated in the body of this volume date from 1927 through 1931. The Encyclopaedia Britannica Article and the Amsterdam Lectures were written by Edmund Hussed (with a short contribution by Martin Heideg ger) between September 1927 and April 1928, and Hussed's marginal notes to Sein und Zeit and Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik were made between 1927 and 1929. The appendices to this volume contain texts from both Hussed and Heidegger, and date from 1929 through 1931. As a whole these materials not only document Hussed's thinking as he approached retirement and emeri tus status (March 31, 1928) but also shed light on the philosophical chasm that was widening at that time between Hussed and his then colleague and protege, Martin Heidegger. 1. The Encyclopaedia Britannica Article Between September and early December 1927, Hussed, under contract, composed an introduction to phenomenology that was to be published in the fourteenth edition ofthe Encyclopaedia Britannica (1929).

Jordan Wright,Psychology,2024-11-05,John Wiley & Sons,,,566,"Integrate cultural awareness and humility into your psychological assessments In Essentials of Culture in Psychological Assessment, editor Jordan A. Wright curates a collection of invaluable work that helps psychological assessors be more deliberate in acknowledging—and, in some cases, mitigating—the role that culture and cultural experiences can play in the psychological assessment process. It encourages assessors to think about cultural issues as they relate to clients, including the cultural background clients bring with them to the assessment and the oppressive experiences they may have endured. You'll explore the roles that power and privilege might play in the assessment process and the cultural variables that affect the interaction with clients and the process as it unfolds. You'll also discover how culture and oppression can be considered and accounted for throughout the entire lifecycle of a psychological assessment. Readers will also find: Tools and strategies for conducting culture-informed and diversity-sensitive psychological assessment Techniques for understanding the data that arises from clients from various backgrounds Ways to integrate culture into every aspect of psychological assessment Perfect for psychology clinicians of all kinds, Essentials of Culture in Psychological Assessment is a can’t-miss resource that will inform, improve, and transform the way you conduct psychological testing and assessment on clients from a variety of cultural backgrounds.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fDkeEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fDkeEQAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fDkeEQAAQBAJ&pg=PA332&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api

H-ZoAgAAQBAJ,Dissemination and Implementation of Evidence-Based Psychological Interventions,"R. Kathryn McHugh, David H. Barlow",Psychology,2012-04-15,Oxford University Press,,,289,"Despite the existence of effective and economical psychological interventions for many mental disorders, the adoption of these treatments in service provision settings worldwide has lagged. A major gap persists between the development and identification of such interventions and their availability to the general public. Building upon the multidisciplinary literature on the science of dissemination and implementation, Dissemination and Implementation of Evidence-Based Psychological Interventions examines state-of-the-art programs to improve access to psychological interventions. Renowned experts describe leading efforts to facilitate the transport of evidence-based treatments, alongside innovative strategies for achieving the goals presented. Analyzing dissemination and implementation programs that range in aims and scope and include both national and local efforts, this book is divided into two parts. Chapters in Part I provide discussion of the history of evidence-based psychological interventions and the need for dissemination and implementation, an overview of the science of dissemination and implementation, and a review of the effectiveness of methods for clinician training. Chapters in Part II describe leading dissemination and implementation programs internationally, including the procedures and practices utilized and data on outcomes. The book concludes with a chapter by the volume's editors that proposes and discusses ten of the most important future directions for the science and practice of dissemination and implementation in mental health care. A crucial challenge in the field today is to translate the successes of treatment development research into the reduction of the public health burden of mental illness on individuals, families, and societies. This pioneering volume will be central to that effort and an essential resource for mental health practitioners and researchers, as well as decision-makers throughout the mental health care system.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H-ZoAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=H-ZoAgAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=H-ZoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api

Key aspects of the Handbook include: an inventory of the principal achievements in the field; a guide to the chief conflicts and difficulties in the theory and research process; a rallying point for researchers who are established or new to the field, which sets the agenda for future developments; a resource book for teachers who wish to establish new curricula and develop courses and programmes in the area of sports studies.

EiNBc1_9mf4C,Max Wertheimer and Gestalt Theory,"D. Brett King, Michael Wertheimer",Biography & Autobiography,2005-01-01,Transaction Publishers,,,458,"The ideas of Max Wertheimer (1880-1943), a founder of Gestalt theory, are discussed in almost all general books on the history of psychology, and in most introductory textbooks on psychology. This intellectual biography of Wertheimer is the first book-length treatment of a scholar whose ideas are recognized as of central importance to fields as varied as social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, problem solving, art, and visual neuroscience. King and Wertheimer trace the origins of Gestalt thought, demonstrating its continuing importance in fifteen chapters and several supplements to these chapters. They begin by reviewing Wertheimer's ancestry, family, and childhood in central Europe, and his formal education. They elaborate on his activities during the period in which he developed the ideas that were later to become central to Gestalt psychology, documenting the formal emergence of this school of thought and tracing its development during World War I. The maturation of the Gestalt school at the University of Berlin during 1922-29 is discussed in detail. Wertheimer's everyday life in America during his last decade is well documented, based in part on his son's recollections. The early reception of Gestalt theory in the United States is examined, with extensive references to articles in professional journals and periodicals. Wertheimer's relationships and interaction with three prominent psychologists of the time, Edwin Boring, Clark Hull, and Alexander Luria, are discussed, based on previosly unpublished correspondence. The final chapters discuss Wertheimer's essays on democracy, freedom, ethics, and truth, detail personal challenges Wertheimer faced during his last years. His major work, published after his death, is Productive Thinking. Its reception is examined, and a concluding chapter considers recent responses to Max Wertheimer and Gestalt theory. This intellectual biography will be of interest to psychologists and readers interested in science, modern European history, and the Holocaust. D. Brett King is senior instructor of psychology, Department of Psychology, University of Colorado at Boulder. Michael Wertheimer is Professor Emeritus of Psychology, University of Colorado at Boulder.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EiNBc1_9mf4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EiNBc1_9mf4C&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EiNBc1_9mf4C&pg=PA256&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api

CsovEAAAQBAJ,EBook: Social Psychology 3e,"David Myers, Jackie Abell, Fabio Sani",Psychology,2020-08-21,McGraw Hill,,,785,"Social psychology has a profound influence on our everyday lives; from our shopping habits to our interactions at a party. It seeks to answer questions that we often think and talk about; questions such as: - What circumstances prompt people to help, or not to help? - What factors influence the ups and downs of our close relationships? - Why do some people behave differently when on their own compared to in a group? - What leads individuals sometimes to hurt, and other times to help one another? - Why are we attracted to certain types of people? - How do some persuade others to do what they want? This new edition of Social Psychology has been revised to introduce a more flexible structure for teaching and studying. It includes up-to-date, international research with an emphasis throughout on its critical evaluation. Applied examples across the chapters help to highlight the relevance, and hence the impact, that the theories and methods of this fascinating subject have upon the social world. Key Features Include: - Research Close-Up: Following a brand-new style, this feature matches the layout used in research papers, providing an accessible introduction to journal articles and the research methods used by social psychologists. - Focus On: Fully revised, these boxes look at opposing viewpoints, controversial research or alternative approaches to the topics. This offers a more critical outlook and prompts the questioning of the validity of published research - Recommended Readings: New to this edition, recommended further readings of both classic and contemporary literature have been added to each chapter, providing a springboard for further consideration of the topics.

This quote from a perplexed undergraduate student illustrates the plight of many first-years who feel overwhelmed by the demands made on them at university, combined with the expectation of lecturers and tutors that they will already know how to study independently.

Covering topics such as using the library and other resources, making effective notes in lectures and successful revision skills, the authors provide a practical guide to help the new student get the most out of their psychology course.

Psychology is a subject that most of us are interested in, and in this text we have tried to show what a versatile discipline psychology is and what an exciting subject it can be to study. The book is designed to show the connections between the various areas of applied psychology. For the most part, applied psychologists tend to produce specialist texts which are relevant to their own area of work. But much of the research in work psychology, for example, is rele vant to the applied areas of sport or health or education, and research into sport psychology has messages for health psychology too. What we is to draw out the relationships between the have tried to do in this text various areas and show how the same basic concepts may manifest themselves in different applied fields.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NikDCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NikDCAAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NikDCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api

How can we make ourselves more efficient? How can we make our lives more worth while?

I have not attempted to write a complete text on psychology. There are already many such books, and good ones too.

Ahe9swEACAAJ,The Teacher's Handbook of Psychology,James Sully,Psychology,2017-12-16,Forgotten Books,,,616,"Excerpt from The Teacher's Handbook of Psychology: On the Basis of ""Outlines of Psychology"" The present edition has been carefully revised through out, largely re-written and enlarged. While seeking to preserve the Original character of the book as an intro duction, I have felt it necessary - ih view of the fact that our best Training Colleges for Secondary Teachers are now making a serious study of psychology - to am plify somewhat and bring up to date the exposition of scientific principles. I have also touched on those recent developments of experimental psychology which have concerned themselves with the measurement of the sim pler mental processes, and which promise to have impor tant educational results by supplying accurate tests of children's abilities. The new branch of the science \known as child-psychology has been more fully drawn upon, from the conviction that it is only when teachers have made a careful study of the spontaneous move ments of children's minds during the first rears that they are likely to find their way readily to the minds of older children, which preserve many more survivals of the earlier mental characteristics than most of us are wont to suppose. The practical applications have pur posely been left in the form of general prescriptions. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

cF99AAAAMAAJ,The Psychology of Reading,"Robert G. Crowder, Richard K. Wagner",Education,1992,"Oxford University Press, USA",,,298,"Cognitive psychologists have discovered that reading represents a natural laboratory for studying almost all cognitive processes -- from sensation and perception to comprehension and reasoning. This introductory textbook examines the important principles of cognitive psychology that pertain to reading, but it is not written for the cognitive psychologist. Though grounded in the latest research, this revision maintains the objective of the first edition -- to provide a highly accessible introduction to students approaching the subject for the first time. Nearly a decade has passed since publication of the first edition of this book. During this period, research on reading has continued at the breakneck pace established in the 1970s, and the growth of knowledge has been substantial. Because the development of knowledge about reading has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary, this new edition provides a timely update of the previous edition, building on principles developed in the earlier book. It is intended to be of use to readers from a variety of disciplines, with differing levels of knowledge about reading. Students of educational psychology and in psychology of reading courses will find this text particularly helpful.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cF99AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cF99AAAAMAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cF99AAAAMAAJ&q=psychology&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=181&source=gbs_api
LgcoDwAAQBAJ,Reflexivity and Psychology,"Giuseppina Marsico, Ruggero Andrisano Ruggieri, Sergio Salvatore",Psychology,2015-11-01,IAP,,,398,"Reflexivity is a category that is too appealing not to arouse interest. It is a concept largely diffused in several psychological domains, as well as associated with epistemological, theoretical, methodological and practical discussions. At the same time, it is a very polysemic notion, understood and used in many different ways. If one approaches the notion and tries to identify the semantic boundaries of its usage, the seeming solidity of the term fades away, and a rather liquid semantic field emerges – a field where several interpretations coexist, being contingent to the context of the discussion in which they are implemented. This is the reason that makes the notion of reflexivity a prototypical example of the difficulties encountered by Psychology – and more in general social sciences –in the effort to define their own language. The term “reflexivity” ? like many others the language of Psychology is full of – is used in daily life and thus its semantics is shaped by the pragmatic, contingent functions it serves in such communicational circumstances. The apparent – from afar ? clearness of the concept does not concern its conceptual, epistemic status, but the capacity of the sign to contribute efficaciously to mediate and regulate the exchange. The theoretical elaboration of the notion of reflexivity can be seen as one of the ways of performing the challenging task of developing an intentional language for Psychology. By working on such a notion one can realize that common sense lies at the core of psychological science and what it means to separate the former from the latter, so as to pursue the foundational task of developing Psychology as a theory?driven science.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgcoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LgcoDwAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LgcoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=182&source=gbs_api

EJkIEQAAQBAJ,In Defence of Empirical Psychology,D. E. Broadbent,Psychology,2014-01-09,Psychology Press,,,234,"Originally published in 1973, this book contains the 1971 William James Lectures at Harvard, the first by that name to be given by a British psychologist. In addition, there are reprints of four shorter lectures which had not been easily available before. Together the resulting collection gave a broad picture of a number of advances in human psychology in the previous ten years. Memory, attention, language, and the processes of decision are discussed, and typical recent ideas and experiments described. Each topic is presented, however, with continual reference to the reasons why the research was done, its implications for philosophy and for scientific method, and its connection with an attitude to politics and life as a whole. The author not only describes little known facts about the way people take decisions or remember, but also argues that we are living through a change in our attitudes to human nature: and that proper concern for human values, or understanding of people with minds different from our own, must demand a more scientific and less intuitive analysis of man. Experiments on human beings still strike many of us as cold-blooded and inhuman; this book tries to explain why some scientists devote themselves to this approach. It makes the connection between measurements of reaction time or of ability to see a written word in a brief flash, and our political and personal beliefs. Donald E. Broadbent is well recognised as a major influence on cognitive psychology today. This reissue is an opportunity to see his exceptional writing in print again and should be read with equal interest by psychologists as well as laymen who would like to know about some of the more practical aspects of psychological enquiry of the time.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EJkIEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EJkIEQAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EJkIEQAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=184&source=gbs_api

Science and technology are central to almost all domains of human activity, for which reason they are the focus of subdisciplines such as philosophy of science, philosophy of technology, sociology of knowledge, and history of science and technology. To date, psychology has been marginal in this space and limited to relatively narrow epistemological orientations. By explicitly embracing pluralism and an international approach, this book offers new perspectives and directions for psychological contributions. The book brings together leading theorists and researchers from around the world and spans scholarship across a variety of traditions that include theoretical psychology, critical psychology, feminist psychology and social constructionist approaches. Following a historical and conceptual introduction, the collection is divided into three sections: Scoping a New Psychology of Science and Technology, Applying Psychological Concepts to the Study of Science and Technology and Critical Perspectives on Psychology as a Science. The book will interest interdisciplinary scholars who work in the space of Science and Technology Studies and psychologists interested in the diverse human aspects of science and technology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fs9ixgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fs9ixgEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fs9ixgEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=185&source=gbs_api

Hofmann,Psychology,2017-10-23,John Wiley & Sons,,,466,"The first book to offer a truly global perspective on the theory and practice of clinical psychology While clinical psychology is practiced the world over, up to now there has been no text devoted to examining it within a global context. The first book of its kind, Clinical Psychology: A Global Perspective brings together contributions from clinicians and scholars around the world to share their insights and observations on the theory and practice of clinical psychology. Due partly to language barriers and entrenched cultural biases, there is little cultural cross-pollination within the field of clinical psychology. In fact, most of the popular texts were written for English-speaking European and Anglo-American audiences and translated for other countries. As a result, most psychologists are unaware of how their profession is conceptualized and practiced in different regions, or how their own practices can be enriched by knowledge of the theories and modalities predominant among colleagues in other parts of the world. This book represents an important first step toward rectifying that state of affairs. Explores key differences and similarities in how clinical psychology is conceptualized and practiced with children, adolescents and adults across different countries and cultures Addresses essential research methods, clinical interviews, psychometric testing, neuropsychological assessments, and dominant treatment modalities Follows a consistent format with each chapter focusing on a specific area of the practice of clinical psychology while integrating cultural issues within the discussion Includes coverage of how to adapt one’s practice to the differing cultures of individual clients, and how to work in multidisciplinary teams within a global context Clinical Psychology: A Global Perspective is a valuable resource for students, trainees, and practicing psychologists, especially those who work with ethnic minority groups or with interpreters.

Using clinical examples - whether people trapped in patterns of dependence, suffering from psychosomatic diseases, or with personality problems - it shows how, by treating clients' issues as failures of the meaning-making process, one can help them change their own own personal meaning. An Introduction to Meaning and Purpose in Analytical Psychology will make provocative reading for all those in helping professions, including counsellors, psychotherapists, and psychiatrists.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J0mFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=J0mFAgAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=J0mFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=206&source=gbs_api

Psychology is the study of human behavior. It is a serious and worthy endeavor that has given us scientific knowledge of the ways our minds make sense of the world. Yet, as cartoonist Grady Klein and psychologist Danny Oppenheimer point out, the study of human experience can also be often really funny. This is the field, after all, that brought us drooling dogs, snacking rats, and “Freudian slips.” With detailed observations on perception, stress, emotions, cognition, and more, Psychology: The Comic Book Introduction offers students and curious readers an entertaining guide to the ways our brains help us navigate incredibly complicated environments, yet often fool us in fascinating ways.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qpFYDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=qpFYDgAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=qpFYDgAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=210&source=gbs_api
Ijt9AAAAMAAJ,Quantum Psychology,Stephen DeBerry,Philosophy,1993-01-30,Praeger,,,232,"This work presents a new and important paradigm modification in psychology that attempts to incorporate ideas from quantum physics and postmodern culture. The author feels that the current diagnostic model of the mental health establishment is too entwined with political and economic factors to represent a valid method for healing psychological problems. The predominant model is too linear, reductionist, normative, and based upon an abnormal view of behavior. Exacerbating this problem is our highly accelerated present-day lifestyle in which new processes and interactions are constantly emerging. The postmodern self is evolving into a manipulative, situational self with no authentic core values. Quantum psychology is a psychology of consciousness and experience and is reflective of the entire process of being. It is a holistic, dynamic, and synergistic model, designed to augment the classical model. It involves non-linear as well as linear models of description, with non-linearity having an association with intuitive and irrational thought. Quantum psychology also attempts to describe the complex reciprocal relationship that exists among consciousness, community, and culture. In part, it is culture that forms our consciousness and consciousness that modifies our culture, with community being the vehicle by which these transactions take place. Quantum psychology represents an emergent system of understanding a consciousness that has been exposed to the complex and accelerating effects of a postmodern culture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ijt9AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ijt9AAAAMAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ijt9AAAAMAAJ&q=psychology&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=211&source=gbs_api

While devoting careful attention to harmful aspects of stereotypes, their connections to prejudice and discrimination, and effective strategies for countering them, the volume also examines the positive functions of generalizations in helping people navigate a complex world. Unique features include four chapters addressing the content of stereotypes, which consider such topics as why certain traits are the focus of stereotyping and how they become attributed to particular groups.

As a conse quence, the topics covered in the upcoming chapters were chosen from among those traditionally of interest to the discipline of social psychology. A criterion for inclusion was the topic's usefulness in providing insights and/or understand ing ofthe social processes at work in sports settings. To this end, I have drawn ex tensively from mainstream journals in social psychology (e. g. , Journal of Per sonality and Social Psychology), and grounded the discussion of topics and issues on the methodologically sound studies/experiments they generally provide. There is also an equally strong interdisciplinary emphasis that features research from physical education, sociology, management science, and education. I have made a further attempt, not as successful as I would have liked, to incorporate a substan tial amount of the fine sports research that has been conducted overseas, particu larly in Europe and Australia. I am hopeful that in bringing together the works of international scholars from a variety of disciplines a clearer and balanced outline of this field will take shape. And now a word about the audience for this text and how to get the most from its pages. I would suggest that the reader have taken a course in social psychology following an introductory-level course.

These scholars probe the increasingly well-documented and complex relations between health and behavior. /// The thrust of these lectures, taken as a whole, is that new knowledge about the complex relationship between health and behavior is providing fertile ground for professionals in the bio-behavioral sciences.

The impact of advertising is often subtle and implicit, but sometimes blatant and impossible to overlook. This book discusses key topics from the fields of social and consumer psychology. Important questions are addressed in the volume such as: What impact does advertising have on consumer behaviour? What causes this impact? What are the psychological processes responsible for the effectiveness of advertising? How do consumers make sense of advertising messages? What messages ""get across"" and when and why? This is the first book to offer a comprehensive and state-of-the-art overview of the psychological findings on the impact of advertising, and to discuss this research in the context of recent developments in the fields of social and consumer psychology. It presents and discusses results of both classic and contemporary studies in an engaging style that avoids highly technical language. The authors have included a glossary of frequently used concepts which assists student comprehension, making it a unique and invaluable volume for advanced undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers and lecturers in social psychology, marketing, and communications.

Research generated by an evolutionary approach to social psychology issues profound insights into self-concept, impression formation, prejudice, group dynamics, helping, aggression, social influence, culture, and every other topic that is fundamental to social psychology.

Readers will emerge with a clear sense of the intellectual challenges, as well as the scientific benefits, of an evolutionarily-informed social psychology. The world-renowned contributors identify new questions, new theories, and new hypotheses—many of which are only now beginning to be tested.

How can we use explanations from health psychology to understand health issues around the world? In Health Psychology in Global Perspective, author Frances E. Aboud uses health psychology to examine the health issues facing developing countries and compares them with issues faced by people in developed countries. She uses a psychosocial perspective rather than the typical biomedical and anthropological perspectives usually applied to health issues in developing countries and integrates diverse literature from a variety of disciplines, including, epidemiology, psychology, education, anthropology, and nursing. Accessible to a broad audience, this volume brings mainstream health psychology concepts to bear on the problems of international health and cross-cultural issues to bear on concepts and theories in mainstream health psychology. It also incorporates a number of pedagogical featuresùcase vignettes, problem solving/debate exercises, case studiesùwhich make it an ideal supplemental text for courses in health psychology. Students will appreciate the extended case studies, while instructors will value the multidisciplinary perspective.

uuEXswEACAAJ,The Handy Psychology Answer Book,Lisa J. Cohen,Psychology,2016,Handy Answer Books,,,544,"Bridging the gap between the entertainment-focused ""pop psychology"" on television and the dry academic research that is published in journals,The Handy Psychology Answer Book helps answer why humans do what we do through accurate scientific data presented in a lively, accessible, and engaging way. It covers the fundamentals and explains the psychology behind how people deal with money, sex, morality, family, children, aging, addiction, work, and other everyday issues. Fully revised to reflect the latest scientific research--such as the currentDSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association); the latest neurobiological theories; and the changing face of marriage--this timely reference has expanded to include information sections on the biology and evolution of emotions; technology and adolescence; bisexuality; optimism; autism; as well as a full section on the law, eyewitness testimony and police shootings. Featuring more than 1,500 answers to questions concerning how the human mind and the science of psychology really work such as:How have other cultures addressed psychological issues? Why was Freud so focused on sex? How can I maintain a healthy brain? Is it normal to argue during marriage? Does religion make people happier? How do we reduce social prejudice?",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uuEXswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uuEXswEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uuEXswEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=246&source=gbs_api

N56OAwAAQBAJ,Self Psychology and Diagnostic Assessment,Marshall L. Silverstein,Psychology,1999,Routledge,,,313,"The self psychology of Heinz Kohut has been an important force in contemporary psychoanalytic thought and its ramifications for therapy have been extensively explored. Now, Marshall Silverstein offers the first analysis of the application of self psychology to projective diagnostic assessment. Differentiating the self psychological approach from an ego psychological interpretation of classical drive theory, he clearly outlines the principal contributions of Kohut, including the concepts of selfobject functions, empathy, transmuting internalization, and compensatory structure. Providing numerous clinical examples, he shows how the major selfobject functions of mirroring, idealization, and twinship can be identified on projective tests. Silverstein then demonstrates how conventional assessment approaches to grandiosity, self-esteem, and idealization can be reconceptualized within the framework of self psychology, and he also contrasts ego psychological interpretations with self psychological interpretations. This book makes a strong case for the importance of the clinical identification of self states. It will help practitioners understand their patients' varied attempts to repair an injury to the self to restore self-esteem (compensatory structure) and the clinical consequences of self-disorders, including disintegration products such as narcissistic rage and affect states characterized by empty depression, chronic boredom, and lack of zest.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N56OAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N56OAwAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N56OAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=256&source=gbs_api

In the last century mainstream psychology has largely neglected the topic of meaning. More recently, the concept has become an academically legitimate one within positive psychology and in some other speciality areas of psychology. This book contains a collection of theoretical, methodological and empirical papers written by the acknowledged experts systematically working on the problems of personal meaning within the positive psychology framework. The authors investigate the possibilities and limitations of a scientific study of personal meaning and new perspectives that this concept brings to the field.

Shohov,Psychology,2002,Nova Publishers,,,290,"Cognitive psychology is concerned with several mental processes, including those involved in perception, attention, learning, memory, problem solving, decision making and the use of language. It is often said that cognitive psychology tries to understand how people represent their experience and then use these representations to operate effectively. Cognitive psychology holds that people are not passive organisms whose mental representations are simple or direct reflections of the outside world. Rater, they are active processors of environmental events, and as such they bring their past knowledge and their biases to bear on how they perceive and understand all current events. Thus perceiving, imagining, thinking, remembering, forming concepts, and solving problems, indeed all aspects of people's mental lives, define the domain of cognitive exploration. This book presents important research which was carefully selected and screened for both current relevance and long-term advancement of the field.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRtNLsO_jdcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PRtNLsO_jdcC&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PRtNLsO_jdcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=326&source=gbs_api

vsVAAAAAMAAJ,Crossroads Between Culture and Mind,Gustav Jahoda,Psychology,1993,,,,242,"The relationship between ""mind"" and ""culture"" has become a prominent--and fashionable--issue in psychology during the last quarter of the twentieth century. The conflict is between those who see the human mind as being generated from--and an intimate part of--culture and those, usually termed cognitivists, who view the mind as essentially separate from the environment. Gustav Jahoda traces the historical origins of this conflict to demonstrate that thinkers' preoccupation with the relationship between mind and culture is not new. The salient issues began to crystallize three centuries ago in Europe in the form of two distinct traditions whose contrasting conceptions of human nature and the human mind still remain the focus of current debates. The dominant tradition was produced by the scientific approach that had proved so successful in the physical realm. This view, associated with the Enlightenment, holds that mind is an essential part of nature and subject to its fixed laws. As a result of the influence of external factors such as climate and ecology, mind creates culture but remains essentially unchanged. The opposite view, which dates back to Vico and was espoused by anti-Enlightenment thinkers, is that the mind is separate from nature, an entity that both creates and is extensively modified by culture in a constant cycle of mutual determination. The growing prestige of experimental psychology has led to a heated debate between supporters of the rival traditions: is psychology a science or a cultural discipline? Jahoda identifies the current form of this debate as but a phase in psychology's long fascination with the role that culture plays in the formation of the mind, which has led to the recent emergence of cultural psychology. Crossroads between Culture and Mind is a formidable achievement by one of Europe's most distinguished and erudite psychologists.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vsVAAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vsVAAAAAMAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vsVAAAAAMAAJ&q=psychology&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=345&source=gbs_api

In this study, the authors gather and analyze interview and observational data from innovation-focused laboratories in the engineering sciences to show how the complex practices of laboratory research scientists provide rich psychological insights, and how a better understanding of science practice facilitates understanding of human beings more generally. The study focuses not on dismantling the rational core of scientific practice, but on illustrating how social, personal, and cognitive processes are intricately woven together in scientific thinking. The book is thus a contribution to science studies, the psychology of science, and general psychology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5zDMyTKliLcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5zDMyTKliLcC&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5zDMyTKliLcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=394&source=gbs_api

It is true that Individual Psychology is concerned with the individual man and explores the paths by which he seeks to find satisfaction for his instincts; but only rarely and under certain exceptional conditions is Individual Psychology in a position to disregard the relations of this individual to others. In the individual's mental life someone else is invariably involved, as a model, as an object, as a helper, as an opponent, and so from the very first Individual Psychology is at the same time Social Psychology as well-in this extended but entirely justifiable sense of the words.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fNNjzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fNNjzQEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fNNjzQEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=395&source=gbs_api

It marked the first application of the relatively new discipline of psychology, and specifically of James's theses in The Principles of Psychology, to educational theory and classroom practice. The book went through twelve printings in as many years and has never been out of print. Among its innovative features were James's maxims ""No reception without reaction"" and ""No impression without expression""; a new emphasis on the biology of behavior and on the role of instincts; and discussions of the relevance to elementary school education of what is known about will, attention, memory, apperception, and the association of ideas. Appended to the fifteen talks to schoolteachers were three talks to college students, as pertinent today as when they were written: ""The Gospel of Relaxation,"" ""On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings,"" and ""What Makes a Life Significant?""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fQ_afRTtS4kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fQ_afRTtS4kC&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fQ_afRTtS4kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=416&source=gbs_api

FWdCDwAAQBAJ,Moral Psychology,"Benjamin G. Voyer, Tor Tarantola",Psychology,2017-12-09,Springer,,,169,"This fascinating and timely volume explores current thinking on vital topics in moral psychology, spanning the diverse disciplines that contribute to the field. Academics from cognitive science, evolutionary biology, anthropology, philosophy, and political science address ongoing and emerging questions aimed at understanding the thought processes and behaviors that underlie our moral codes—and our transgressions. Cross-cutting themes speak to individual, interpersonal, and collective morality in such areas as the development of ethical behavior, responses to violations of rules, moral judgments in the larger discourse, and universal versus specific norms. This wide-angle perspective also highlights the implications of moral psychology research for policy and justice, with cogent viewpoints from: · Philosophy: empiricism and normative questions, moral relativism. · Evolutionary biology: theories of how altruism and moral behavior evolved. · Anthropology: common moral values seen in ethnographies from different countries. · Cognitive and neural sciences: computational models of moral systems and decision-making. · Political science: politics, governance, and moral values in the public sphere. · Advice on moral psychology research—and thoughts about its future—from prominent scholars. With the goal of providing a truly multidisciplinary forum for moral psychology, this volume is sure to spark conversations across disciplines and advance the field as a whole. Sampling the breadth and depth of an equally expansive and transformative field, Moral Psychology: A Multidisciplinary Guide will find an engaged audience among psychologists, philosophers, evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, political scientists, neuroscientists, lawyers, and policymakers, as well as a more general audience interested in better understanding the complexity of moral psychology research.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FWdCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FWdCDwAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FWdCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=421&source=gbs_api

IIEMWMEHNL4C,The Psychology of Culture,Edward Sapir,Language Arts & Disciplines,2011-03-01,Walter de Gruyter,,,293,"This work presents Sapir's most comprehensive statement on the concepts of culture, on method and theory in anthropology and other social sciences, on personality organization, and on the individual's place in culture and society. Extensive discussions on the role of language and other symbolic systems in culture, ethnographic method, and social interaction are also included. Ethnographic and linguistic examples are drawn from Sapir's fieldwork among native North Americans and from European and American society as well. Edward Sapir (1884-1939), one of this century's leading figures in American anthropology and linguistics, planned to publish a major theoretical state - ment on culture and psychology. He developed his ideas in a course of lectures presented at Yale University in the 1930s, which attracted a wide audience from many social science disciplines. Unfortunately, he died before the book he had contracted to publish could be realized. Like de Saussure's Cours de Linguistique Générale before it, this work has been reconstructed from student notes, in this case twentytwo sets, as well as from Sapir's manuscript materials. Judith Irvine's meticulous reconstruction makes Sapir's compelling ideas - of surprisingly contemporary resonance - available for the first time.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IIEMWMEHNL4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IIEMWMEHNL4C&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IIEMWMEHNL4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=435&source=gbs_api

He is best known for being one of the main proponents of phrenology. This title, originally published in 1922 contains the reflections of the author on his experience as a physician specialising in nervous and mental disorders. He looks at a range of patients ""suffering from character defects leading to moral failings..."" finding that these cases of ""moral derangement"" come in all kinds. Very much of its time, he suggests that treating the causes should be with both physical and mental measures, including psychotherapy, which at the time consisted of ""persuasion, suggestion, auto-suggestion, hypnotism, psychological analysis, as well as re-education.""

But according to leading psychologist, James Garbarino, this is the peak time for people to enhance their optimism, empathy, and emotional responsiveness. In his important new book, The Positive Psychology of Personal Transformation, Dr. Garbarino reveals the social basis for moral development in adversity, and the mental and physical benefits of psychological and spiritual growth. Drawing widely on his years as a healing professional and own experience of personal crisis as well as on decades of resilience and happiness literature, the author traces the evolution of the moral sense that affects all human relationships, including the one with the Earth itself. In these compelling pages, Dr. Garbarino: Examines how humans’ deep bonds with dogs can model positive human relationships. Compares the risks and benefits of the “oblivious” versus the self-aware life. Analyzes the role of trauma in heightening our sense of the meaning of life and defines the experience of transformational grace in adversity. Explains current manifestations of narcissism and the need for “the positive death of the self.” Asserts that every person is capable of “living an ‘extraordinary’ life.” A book with vast significance across the healing disciplines, The Positive Psychology of Personal Transformation should be read, savored, and practiced by researchers, practitioners, and scientists in clinical child, school, and developmental psychology; social work; educational and community psychology; sociology; and public health.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jr3TjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jr3TjwEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jr3TjwEACAAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=448&source=gbs_api

EGmtDwAAQBAJ,Hugo Münsterberg's Psychology and Law,"Brian H. Bornstein, Jeffrey S. Neuschatz",Law,2020,,,,353,"Though widely regarded as a founder of the modern field of psychology and law, German-American psychologist Hugo Münsterberg's now century-old ideas and research approaches continue to thrive. In fact, the discipline still grapples with many of the issues raised by Münsterberg in his seminal 1908 book, On the Witness Stand.Hugo Münsterberg's Psychology and Law makes Münsterberg's enduring insights available to a new generation of scholars, presenting the ""state of the science"" on the concepts that Münsterberg was one of the first to investigate. These include eyewitness memory, deception detection, false confessions, and the causes of criminal behavior. Opening with a brief biography of Münsterberg and a historical overview of the field, the book's organization follows that of On the Witness Stand, with each chapter providing a summary of Münsterberg's work followed by a contemporary perspective on the topic. Chapters challenge readers to consider what we have learned since Münsterberg's time and whether subsequent research has shown him to be right or wrong. The final chapter asks what Münsterberg may have missed, and what we may be missing today. This volume will be of interest to a broad range of scholars, practitioners, and professionals in the legal and mental health fields.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGmtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EGmtDwAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EGmtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=450&source=gbs_api

fcWjCwAAQBAJ,Child Psychology,"Lawrence Balter, Catherine S. Tamis-LeMonda",Psychology,2016-02-26,Psychology Press,,,523,"This third edition of Child Psychology continues the tradition of showcasing cutting-edge research in the field of developmental science, including individual differences, dynamic systems and processes, and contexts of development. While retaining a similar structure to the last edition, this revision consists of completely new content with updated programmatic research and contemporary research trends and interests. The first three sections highlight research that is organized chronologically by age: Infancy, Childhood, and Adolescence. Within each section, individual chapters address contemporary research on a specific area of development, such as learning, cognition, social, and emotional development at that period in childhood. The fourth section, Ecological Influences, emphasizes contextual influences relevant to children of all ages, including risk and protective processes, family and neighborhood context, race and ethnicity, peer relations, the effects of poverty, and the impact of the digital world. Child Psychology also features a unique focus on four progressive themes. First, emphasis is placed on theory and explanation—the ""why and how"" of the developmental process. Second, explanations of a transactional and multidimensional nature of development are at the forefront of all chapters. Third, the multi-faceted approach to development highlights contextual influences and cultural diversity among children from different communities and backgrounds. Finally, methodological innovation is a key concern, and research tools presented across chapters span the full array available to developmental scientists who focus on different systems and levels of analysis. The thoroughness and depth of this book, in addition to its methodological rigor, make it an ideal handbook for researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and advanced students across a range of disciplines, including psychology, education, economics and public policy.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fcWjCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fcWjCwAAQBAJ&dq=psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fcWjCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychology&hl=&cd=457&source=gbs_api

Students, in particular, can experience problems with the requirements of writing papers in psychology. This book is a comprehensive companion to the entire writing process, covering: - Thinking analytically and critically - Taking notes - Organizing information and ideas - Preparing and planning - Writing drafts and editing. It emphasizes the principles and logic underlying the thinking and writing process, so that these may be applied to a range of essays, literature reviews and research reports.

I have selected a number of the 'classical' experiments of Experimental Psychology, and have tried to present them in such a way that their performance shall have a real disciplinary value for the undergraduate student. Within this general purpose, my aim has been two-fold. I have sought to show, in the first place, that psychology is above the laboratory: that we employ our instruments of precision not for their own sake, but solely because they help us to a refined and more accurate introspection. And secondly, just as in my Outline of Psychology and Primer of Psychology I gave the results of experimentation a prominent place in the psychological system, so here I have treated the selected experiments not as separate exercises, but as points of departure for systematic discussion.

QBuk4Ov_Fg0C,Thinking About Starting a Business?,Gary Thomas,Business & Economics,2012-01-31,Author House,,,132,"Why should you go to the trouble of creating a written business plan? There are three major reasons: The process of putting a business plan together, including the thought you put in before beginning to write it, forces you to take an objective, critical unemotional look at your business project in its entirety. The finished product your business plan is and operating told which, properly used, will help you manage your business and work toward its success. The completed business plan is the means for communicating your ideas to others and provide the basis for your financing proposal. The importance of planning cannot be overemphasized. By taking an objective look at your business you can identify areas of weakness and strengths, pinpoint needs you might otherwise overlook, spot problems before they arise, and begin planning how you can best achieve your business goals. As an operating tool, your business plan helps you to establish reasonable objectives and figure out how to best accomplish them. It also helps you to red-flag problems as they arise and aids you to identifying their sources, thus suggesting ways to solve them. It may even help you avoid some problems altogether. This handbook has been designed with these considerations in mind. In order for it to work it is important that you do as much of the work as possible. A professionally prepared business plan wont do you any good if you dont understand it thoroughly. This understanding comes from being involved with its development from the very start. No business plan, no matter how carefully constructed and no matter how thoroughly understood, will be of any use at all unless you use it. Going into business is rough; over half of all new businesses fail within the first two years of operation and over 90 percent fail within the first 10 years. A major reason for failure is lack of planning. The best way to enhance your chances of success is to plan and follow through on your planning. Use your plan. Dont put it in the bottom drawer of your desk and forget it. Your business plan can help you avoid going into a business venture that is doomed to failure. If your proposed venture is marginal at best, the business plan will show you why and may help you avoid paying the high tuition of business failure. It is far cheaper not to begin an ill-fated business than to learn by experience what your business plan could have taught you at several hours of concentrated work. Finally, your business plan provides the information needed by others to evaluate your venture, especially if you need to seek outside financing. A thorough business automatically becomes a complete financing proposal which will meet the requirements of most lenders.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QBuk4Ov_Fg0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QBuk4Ov_Fg0C&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QBuk4Ov_Fg0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=business&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api

2TqIDwAAQBAJ,The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses,"Fernando Almeida, José Santos",Business & Economics,2018-12-10,River Publishers,,,242,"There is a great worldwide desire to launch new technology-based business. In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of ""Chapter V - Prototype description"" which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2TqIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2TqIDwAAQBAJ&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2TqIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=business&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api

'Business Planning' outlines the options and risks involved in setting up a business. The importance of thorough planning is often overlooked and only becomes evident if the business fails. This is highlighted in a recent study by the SFEDI of 486 bankers and accountants where lack of planning was the most common reason cited as to why businesses fail. 'Business Planning' shows how to avoid this failure by focusing on the planning stage and building on this framework as the business develops. This is the only book based around the Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative (SFEDI) for first time owner-managers. It contains all the underpinning factual information required to prepare and present a successful Business Plan for presentation to a bank manager, or an alternative potential source of finance, or for use in an NVQ portfolio. It is in line with the major syllabuses for Business Start-Up, and can be used as a course book for anyone completing a formal NVQ level 3 qualification in this area, with tips on NVQ structure and assessment.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cbRkjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cbRkjwEACAAJ&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cbRkjwEACAAJ&dq=business&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api

The paper will aim to simplify, as much as possible, the meaning and types of Joint Venture and argue in favour of a regulatory statute for Joint Ventures, with special reference to Resources Joint Ventures as obtainable in Australia and New Zealand.

The classical eco- mics books have developed different theories and considered several f- tors that could explain those processes. Unfortunately, a single answer has not been obtained and nowadays economists try also to achieve a response to the mechanism of economic growth. Economic growth has been considered as one of the most relevant e- nomic policy. As it is well known, the validity of an economic policy is measured in terms of economic growth rate. It is supposed that those countries that obtain a higher economic growth rate are designing more efficient economic policies than those that show lower rates. The main corollary to this hypothesis is that the developing countries must follow and copy the economic policies designed by the developed countries.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GqY-ufrd2EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GqY-ufrd2EMC&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GqY-ufrd2EMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=business&hl=&cd=175&source=gbs_api

QWQRDAAAQBAJ,Business and Human Rights,"Dorothée Baumann-Pauly, Justine Nolan",Law,2016-04-28,Routledge,,,350,"In a global economy, multinational companies often operate in jurisdictions where governments are either unable or unwilling to uphold even the basic human rights of their citizens. The expectation that companies respect human rights in their own operations and in their business relationships is now a business reality that corporations need to respond to. Business and Human Rights: From Principles to Practice is the first comprehensive and interdisciplinary textbook that addresses these issues. It examines the regulatory framework that grounds the business and human rights debate and highlights the business and legal challenges faced by companies and stakeholders in improving respect for human rights, exploring such topics as: the regulatory framework that grounds the business and human rights debate, challenges faced by companies and stakeholders in improving human rights, industry-specific human rights standards, current mechanisms to hold corporations to account, future challenges for business and human rights. With supporting case studies throughout, this text provides an overview of current themes in the field and guidance on practical implementation, demonstrating that a thorough understanding of the human rights challenges faced by business is now vital in any business context.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QWQRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QWQRDAAAQBAJ&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QWQRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=business&hl=&cd=284&source=gbs_api

Kanji,Business & Economics,2012-10-12,Taylor & Francis,,,257,"Business Excellence and Total Quality Management (TQM) models provide a means of measuring the satisfaction of customers, employees and shareholders simultaneously. A number of such models currently exist, but, the author argues, none of these address all dimensions of TQM.

Companies operate in a world of change influenced by globalisation, volatile markets, legal changes and technical progress. As a result, they have to handle growing volumes of data and therefore require fast storage, reliable data access, intelligent retrieval of information and automated decision-making mechanisms, all provided at the highest level of service quality. Successful enterprises are aware of these challenges and efficiently respond to the dynamic environment in which their business operates. Business Intelligence (BI) and Performance Management (PM) offer solutions to these challenges and provide techniques to enable effective business change. The important aspects of both topics are discussed within this state-of-the-art volume. It covers the strategic support, business applications, methodologies and technologies from the field, and explores the benefits, issues and challenges of each. Issues are analysed from many different perspectives, ranging from strategic management to data technologies, and the different subjects are complimented and illustrated by numerous examples of industrial applications. Contributions are authored by leading academics and practitioners representing various universities, research centres and companies worldwide. Their experience covers multiple disciplines and industries, including finance, construction, logistics, and public services, amongst others.

The authors describe the fundamental principles of digitization and its economic opportunities and risks, integrating them into a framework of classic and new management methods. The book also explores how increasing digitization – not only of communication, but of complete value chains – has led to a need to establish a digital business leadership. Digitization is changing people and markets: it causes the upheaval of entire industries, creates new digital-centric companies, and forces established companies to cope with the transformation activities associated with these digitization processes. New approaches and methods have to be learned, tried and tested patterns of thinking have to be explored, and last but not least, innovation activities have to be understood as continuous necessities. At the same time, digital business offers considerable opportunities for renewing competitive advantages, improving existing process structures and realigning products, services and business models.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yWBewAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yWBewAEACAAJ&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yWBewAEACAAJ&dq=business&hl=&cd=454&source=gbs_api

This is the Information Paradox - the conflict between the widely held belief that information, and investment in IT to provide that information, is a ""good thing"" and the all too frequent reality that we cannot demonstrate a connection between IT investments and business results."" ""John Thorp and Fujitsu Consulting have continued to work with many clients around the world, implementing the Benefits Realization Approach - a unique, client-tested framework that introduces a benefits-focused mindset. Their experience has led to the understanding that the issues with IT value are merely a symptom of a broader business value problem, and to the development of a new, expanded approach - Enterprise Value Management."" ""A completely new Afterword outlines this new approach which goes beyond the challenge of IT value to provide a comprehensive value-driven organizational governance process. It builds on the foundation of benefits realization to help organizations manage value in an increasingly uncertain and real-time business environment.

xdO2oAEACAAJ,Personal Business,Aeron Hunt,Business in literature,2014,,,,0,"In recent years the analysis of the intersection of literature and economics has generated a vibrant conversation in literary and cultural studies of the Victorian period. But Aeron Hunt argues that an emphasis on abstraction and impersonality as the crucial features of the Victorian economic experience has led to a partial and ultimately misleading vision of Victorian business culture. In contrast, she asserts that the key to understanding the relationship of literary writing to economic experience is what she calls ""personal business""--the social and interpersonal relationships of Victorian commercial life in which character was a central mediating concept. Juxtaposing novels by Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Margaret Oliphant with such nonfiction works as popular biographies, periodicals, and business handbooks, the author builds on and extends the insights of the ""new economic criticism"" by highlighting the embodied, interpersonal, and socially embedded interactions of everyday economic life. Hunt analyzes the productive and disciplinary roles that character played in the Victorian economy and traces the proliferation of different models of character as literary writing and commercial discourse responded to the challenges and opportunities presented by personal business. She suggests that the dynamic interchange between forms of character employed in the everyday practice of business and those imagined in literary writing helped shape character as a crucial mode of power in Victorian business culture and economic life. Ultimately, Personal Business provides new ways to understand both the history of the Victorian novel and its implications in middle-class culture and the turbulent experience of nineteenth-century capitalism.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xdO2oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xdO2oAEACAAJ&dq=business&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xdO2oAEACAAJ&dq=business&hl=&cd=477&source=gbs_api

These bold goals can be met in all parts of the world if nations follow through on their commitments to work together to meet them. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals offers the prospect of a more secure, just, and prosperous world for all. The UN Millennium Project was commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to develop a practical plan of action to meet the Millennium Development Goals. As an independent advisory body directed by Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, the UN Millennium Project submitted its recommendations to the UN Secretary General in January 2005. The core of the UN Millennium Project's work has been carried out by 10 thematic Task Forces comprising more than 250 experts from around the world, including scientists, development practitioners, parliamentarians, policymakers, and representatives from civil society, UN agencies, the World Bank, the IMF, and the private sector. This report lays out the recommendations of the UN Millennium Project Task Force 5 Working Group on Access to Essential Medicine. The Working Group recommends increasing the availability, affordability, and appropriate use of medicines in developing countries. This will require new incentives for research; better procurement, supply and distribution; strengthened primary health systems; pro-poor planning and budgeting; close collaboration with communities; and large increases in funding and the number of health workers. These bold yet practical approaches will ensure that substantially more people living in developing countries will have access to essential medicines by 2015.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dDG5REyrRmIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dDG5REyrRmIC&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dDG5REyrRmIC&pg=PT211&dq=health&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api

Shahidullah",Psychology,2018-11-09,Springer,,,318,"This handbook addresses the delivery of high quality pediatric behavioral healthcare services that are multitiered, evidence-based, and integrated, involving interprofessional collaboration across child serving systems, such as pediatrician offices and schools. The book sets forth a contemporary, leading edge approach that reflects the relationship between biological and psychosocial development and the influence of multiple systems, including the family, community, school, and the healthcare system on child development and functioning. It assists child-focused providers in developing knowledge about the relationship between biological and psychosocial development and between pediatric physical health and behavioral health problems. Chapters cover common chronic illnesses and behavioral conditions and include guidelines for screening, assessment, diagnosis, prevention, and coordinated intervention. Chapters also include representative case studies that help illustrate efficacious, effective service-delivery approaches. The handbook concludes with recommendations for future research and directions for integrated pediatric behavioral healthcare. Topics featured in the Handbook include: Behavioral health aspects of chronic physical health conditions, including asthma, diabetes, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, and cancer. Physical health implications of behavioral health and educational problems, including ADHD, learning disabilities, substance abuse, and ASD. Coping with chronic illness and medical stress. Patient adherence to medical recommendations and treatments. School reintegration after illness. The Handbook of Pediatric Behavioral Healthcare is a must-have resource for researchers, professors, and graduate students as well as clinicians, therapists, and other practitioners in clinical child and school psychology, primary care medicine, social work, child and adolescent psychiatry, public health, health psychology, pediatric medicine, nursing, behavioral therapy, rehabilitation, and counseling.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uq14DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Uq14DwAAQBAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Uq14DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=health&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api

The Learning Healthcare System considers how health care is structured to develop and to apply evidence-from health profession training and infrastructure development to advances in research methodology, patient engagement, payment schemes, and measurement-and highlights opportunities for the creation of a sustainable learning health care system that gets the right care to people when they need it and then captures the results for improvement. This book will be of primary interest to hospital and insurance industry administrators, health care providers, those who train and educate health workers, researchers, and policymakers. The Learning Healthcare System is the first in a series that will focus on issues important to improving the development and application of evidence in health care decision making. The Roundtable on Evidence-Based Medicine serves as a neutral venue for cooperative work among key stakeholders on several dimensions: to help transform the availability and use of the best evidence for the collaborative health care choices of each patient and provider; to drive the process of discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care; and, ultimately, to ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VWmjvCZOFjoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VWmjvCZOFjoC&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VWmjvCZOFjoC&pg=PA141&dq=health&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api

The United States spends approximately 20% of its gross national product on healthcare, but it is unclear where the money goes or who is minding the store. This healthcare crisis is mostly about money--not lack of money, but rather misspending of money. From the perspective of a healthcare auditor and provider, this work describes the problems of American healthcare finance and proposes solutions. Extensive charts and graphs are used to trace where money goes in the American healthcare system, while other topics such as ethics in healthcare billing, un-auditable hospital costs and scams are discussed. There is evidence that clearly identifies where the money goes, and its destination may surprise the reader.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eFPVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=eFPVEAAAQBAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=eFPVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA212&dq=health&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api

1arGI9NZcAkC,An Introductory Philosophy of Medicine,James A. Marcum,Medical,2008-05-07,Springer Science & Business Media,,,371,"In this book the author explores the shifting philosophical boundaries of modern medical knowledge and practice occasioned by the crisis of quality-of-care, especially in terms of the various humanistic adjustments to the biomedical model. To that end he examines the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical boundaries of these medical models. He begins with their metaphysics, analyzing the metaphysical positions and presuppositions and ontological commitments upon which medical knowledge and practice is founded. Next, he considers the epistemological issues that face these medical models, particularly those driven by methodological procedures undertaken by epistemic agents to constitute medical knowledge and practice. Finally, he examines the axiological boundaries and the ethical implications of each model, especially in terms of the physician-patient relationship. In a concluding Epilogue, he discusses how the philosophical analysis of the humanization of modern medicine helps to address the crisis-of-care, as well as the question of “What is medicine?” The book’s unique features include a comprehensive coverage of the various topics in the philosophy of medicine that have emerged over the past several decades and a philosophical context for embedding bioethical discussions. The book’s target audiences include both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as healthcare professionals and professional philosophers. “This book is the 99th issue of the Series Philosophy and Medicine...and it can be considered a crown of thirty years of intensive and dynamic discussion in the field. We are completely convinced that after its publication, it can be finally said that undoubtedly the philosophy of medicine exists as a special field of inquiry.”",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1arGI9NZcAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1arGI9NZcAkC&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1arGI9NZcAkC&pg=PA74&dq=health&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api

The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition. The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all. Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common danger. Healthy development of the child is of basic importance; the ability to live harmoniously in a changing total environment is essential to such development. The extension to all peoples of the benefits of medical, psychological and related knowledge is essential to the fullest attainment of health. Informed opinion and active co-operation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people. Governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.",,http://books.google.com/books?id=O0IBfAEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=O0IBfAEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=133&source=gbs_api

How can we advance our understanding of the full extent of health inequality, what drives it, and ways to address it? The third edition of this popular book closely examines the influence of social class, gender, and race/ethnicity (among other issues) on health in the light of broad macro-political contexts. The classic behavioural, psychosocial, and material approaches to health and their embodiment within a life-course perspective are introduced but, importantly, are also re-situated within the growing understanding of the commercial and political determinants of health. Bartley and Kelly-Irving draw on extensive new evidence that shows how the chances for everyone to lead a long and healthy life depend on where power lies to control health-damaging policies and introduce health-promoting ones. Health Inequality will continue to be essential reading for students taking courses in the sociology of health and illness, social policy and welfare, health sciences, public health and epidemiology and all those interested in understanding the consequences of social inequality for health.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0Riu0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0Riu0AEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0Riu0AEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=355&source=gbs_api

The book tackles a range of topics including social media’s role in healthcare, the gathering of shared information, and the integration of clinical and social media data. Application examples of social media for health monitoring, along with its usage in patient treatment are also provided. The book also considers the ethical and legal issues of gathering and utilizing social media data, along with the risks and challenges that must be considered when integrating social media data into healthcare choices.

893DmAEACAAJ,Knowledge Management in Public Health,"Jay Liebowitz, Richard A Schieber, Joanne Andreadis",Computers,2009-07-29,CRC Press,,,0,"Close collaboration across agencies and international borders is mandatory for public health officials. A powerful tool for sharing knowledge, knowledge management (KM) can help public health professionals quickly collaborate and disseminate knowledge for solving public health issues worldwide. The latest initiatives for reforming healthcare have put the spotlight on the need for maximizing resources. In addition to providing a platform for sharing knowledge, KM can help healthcare professionals do more with less. One tool, two problems solved. Yet the sharing of knowledge and KM continues to be a major challenge in the public health field. Knowledge Management in Public Health provides a general introduction to KM and social networking in the public health arena. The book begins with coverage of basic principles, components, and methodologies as well as trends and key issues in public health. It includes ten case studies illustrating applications of KM and social networking in public health. The chapters are written by leading individuals from organizations involved in applying KM in public health worldwide. The editors and chapter authors explore the many elements of KM, delineating how and why to start such an initiative. They provide specific examples of the development and value-added benefits of KM in a variety of public health environments. Tough or quick decision making has always benefitted enormously from knowledge based on the maximum amount of pertinent information available at the time—this has not changed. What is new in the present public health environment is the need to do this more often, with fewer personnel available, and increased expectations relative to the services expected by the public. Better use of information under a KM system is well suited to serve that purpose. This book explores the many ways to use KM to anticipate potential health issues and quickly resolve key incidents when they occur.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=893DmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=893DmAEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=893DmAEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=406&source=gbs_api

_L42zgEACAAJ,Routledge International Handbook of Critical Issues in Health and Illness,"Kerry Chamberlain, Antonia Lyons",Psychology,2021,Routledge,,,364,"""The Routledge International Handbook of Critical Issues in Health and Illness is a multidisciplinary reference book that brings together cutting-edge health and illness topics from around the globe. It offers a range of theoretical and critical perspectives to provide contemporary insights into complex health issues that can offer ways to address inequitable patterns of illness and ill-health. This collection, written by an international pool of expert academics from a range of disciplinary backgrounds, is unique in providing theoretical and critical analyses on key health topics, considering power and broader social structures that influence health and illness outcomes. The chapters are organised in three parts. The first covers medical contexts; here chapters provide commentary and critical analysis of the history of medicine, medicalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, services and care, medical technology, diagnosis, screening, medical technology, and complementary and alternative medicine. The second part covers life contexts; chapters cover a range of life contexts which have implications for health, including gender, sexuality, reproduction, disability, ethnicity, indigeneity, inequality, ageing, and dying. The third part covers shifting contextual domains; chapters consider contemporary areas of life that are rapidly changing, including health in relation to inequality, gender, sexual orientation, reproduction, ethnicity, indigeneity, disability, ageing, commercialisation, climate change, and globalisation. The Routledge International Handbook of Critical Issues in Health and Illness is a key contemporary reference text for scholars, students, researchers, and professionals across disciplines including sociology, psychology, anthropology, geography, medicine, public health, and health science""--",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_L42zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_L42zgEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_L42zgEACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=411&source=gbs_api

Truly global in its scope, this book presents a unified, structured understanding of how the design of a country's health institutions influence its healthcare activities and outcomes. Building on the 'public choice' tradition in political economy, the authors explore how patient-citizens interact with their country's political institutions to determine the organisation of the health system. The book discusses a number of institutional influences of a health system, such as federalism, the nature of collective action, electoral competition, constitutional designs, political ideologies, the welfare effects of corruption and lobbying and, more generally, the dynamics of change. Whilst drawing on the theoretical concepts of political economy, this book describes an institution-grounded analysis of health systems in an accessible way. We hope it will appeal to both undergraduate and graduate students studying health economics, health policy and public policy.

The sixth edition has been thoroughly revised and updated, offering a global and comprehensive perspective on wide ranging public health needs and priorities in modern health care. The sixth edition retains its approach of dividing the complex, dynamic subject of public health into three topics. 'The Scope of Public Health' discusses the development of the discipline, determinants of health and disease, public health policies, and law and ethics. Next, the textbook focuses on 'The Methods of Public Health', including the main science behind the discipline - epidemiology. Finally, 'The Practice of Public Health', examines specific public health problems and the options for prevention and control. As well as identifying these issues by system or disease, there is also an awareness of the unique needs of particular population groups. New topics in this edition include: Climate change, genetic testing and epidemiology; new methods for measuring the burden of disease; life course approaches to epidemiology, behavioural economics; and physical activity, health and wellbeing. Two new editors, Quarraisha Abdool Karim (South Africa) and Chorh Chuan Tan (Singapore), join the established editor team of Roger Detels (USA), and Martin Gulliford (UK), representing a truly global outlook. The contributors are experts who have been drawn from around the world, offering perspectives from vastly different health systems with ranging public health needs and priorities. The Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health remains the most comprehensive, accessible text in the field, and is an essential reference for students and practitioners in public health and epidemiology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aplPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aplPDwAAQBAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aplPDwAAQBAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=438&source=gbs_api

V5mU2rBU-wwC,Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine,"Marthe R. Gold, Joanna E. Siegel, Louise B. Russell, Milton C. Weinstein",Medical,1996-07-18,Oxford University Press,,,450,"A unique, in-depth discussion of the uses and conduct of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) as decision-making aids in the health and medical fields, this volume is the product of over two years of comprehensive research and deliberation by a multi-disciplinary panel of economists, ethicists, psychometricians, and clinicians. Exploring cost-effectiveness in the context of societal decision-making for resource allocation purposes, this volume proposes that analysts include a ""reference-case"" analysis in all CEAs designed to inform resource allocation and puts forth the most explicit set of guidelines (together with their rationale) ever defined on the conduct of CEAs. Important theoretical and practical issues encountered in measuring costs and effectiveness, evaluating outcomes, discounting, and dealing with uncertainty are examined in separate chapters. Additional chapters on framing and reporting of CEAs elucidate the purpose of the analysis and the effective communication of its findings. Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine differs from the available literature in several key aspects. Most importantly, it represents a consensus on standard methods--a feature integral to a CEA, whose principal goal is to permit comparisons of the costs and health outcomes of alternative ways of improving health. The detailed level at which the discussion is offered is another major distinction of this book, since guidelines in journal literature and in CEA-related books tend to be rather general--to the extent that the analyst is left with little guidance on specific matters. The focused overview of the theoretical background underlying areas of controversy and of methodological alternatives, and, finally, the accessible writing style make this volume a top choice on the reading lists of analysts in medicine and public health who wish to improve practice and comparability of CEAs. The book will also appeal to decision-makers in government, managed care, and industry who wish to consider the uses and limitations of CEAs.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V5mU2rBU-wwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=V5mU2rBU-wwC&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=V5mU2rBU-wwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=health&hl=&cd=445&source=gbs_api

In Adventist Heritage of Health, Hope, and Healing, readers will be spellbound by stories of: The fledgling Western Health Reform Institute which became the largest health care institute of its kind. The $5,000 miracle that led to the founding of Loma Linda University Medical Center, one of the nation's premier medical facilities in southern California. The China Doctor, Grandma Whitney, and the humble academician with three doctorate degrees, who have influenced thousands through an integration of practical religion and health. The prophetic Comprehensive Health Vision that outlines a 10-step program for adding years to your life. In this book, Dr. Andress explores little known historical connections that coalesce into a persuasive case for a Christian theology of healing and wellness. Throughout the book, personal anecdotes and illustrations provide a vivid and tangible portrait of a man seeking to better understand and live out the divine plan for health of body, mind, and soul.

Women and men play different roles, frequent different public areas, and face different health risks. Women suffer disproportionately from disease, injury, and violence because their access to resources is often more limited than that of their male counterparts. Yet, when women are healthy and safe, so are their families and communities. Urban policy makers and public health professionals need to understand how conditions in densely populated places can help or harm the well-being of women in order to serve this large segment of humanity.

Disorders such as depression, alcohol abuse, and schizophrenia constitute about 13 percent of the total burden of disease. Worldwide, MNS disorders are the leading cause of disability, and the 10th leading cause of death. Despite this high burden, there is a significant shortage of resources available to prevent, diagnose, and treat MNS disorders. Approximately four out of five people with serious MNS disorders living in low- and middle-income countries do not receive needed health services. This treatment gap is particularly high in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Challenges to MNS care in SSA countries include a lack of trained mental health professionals, few mental health facilities, and low prioritization for MNS disorders in budget allocations. African countries, on average, have one psychiatrist for every 2 million people, whereas European countries have one psychiatrist per 12,000 people. Expanding on previous efforts to address the development and improvement of sustainable mental health systems in SSA, the Institute of Medicine convened this 2015 workshop series, bringing together key stakeholders to examine country-specific opportunities to improve the health care infrastructure in order to better prevent, diagnose, and treat MNS disorders.

This book argues that health policy making is being affected by globalisation and that these effects are, in turn, contributing to the kind of global health issues being faced today. The book explores how the actors, context, processes and content of health policy are changing as a result of globalisation, raising concerns about growing differences in who can influence health policy, what priorities are set, what interventions are deemed appropriate and ultimately who enjoys good and bad health. Bringing together a distinguished, international group of contributors, this book covers a comprehensive range of topics and geographic regions and will be invaluable for all those interested in health, social and public policy and globalisation.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yyy3PqOP2FYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yyy3PqOP2FYC&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yyy3PqOP2FYC&dq=health&hl=&cd=464&source=gbs_api

gQ4BvgAACAAJ,Global Handbook on Noncommunicable Diseases and Health Promotion,David V. McQueen,Medical,2016-09-16,Springer,,,0,"Global Handbook on Noncommunicable Diseases and Health Promotion David V. McQueen, editor A scan of health challenges around the globe readily brings to mind a range of infectious illnesses, from HIV to influenza. Yet chronic non-contagious conditions--heart disease, asthma, diabetes, cancer--are more prevalent, and their rates soaring, across the developed and developing worlds. The Global Handbook on Noncommunicable Diseases and Health Promotion is an important resource for understanding and approaching chronic illnesses and their prevention. This timely text balances theory and strategies to provide an integrative context for health-affecting behaviors regarding tobacco use, food choices, and physical activity. Coverage expands on current medical/clinical public health perspectives, arguing that closer attention to social context is crucial to better use of health resources and more relevant preventive efforts. Possible roles for hospitals, the workplace, government agencies, NGOs, and other institutions are analyzed, as is the potential for addressing larger underlying health factors (e.g., inequities and poverty) at the societal level. Topics covered include: The nature of causality: beyond traditional evidence Learning from the social sciences in chronic disease health promotion Contextual factors in health and illness Understanding and applying a social determinants of health framework for addressing NCDs Public health, NCDs, health promotion and business partnering NCDs and civil society: a history and a roadmap As the authors of the Global Handbook on Noncommunicable Diseases and Health Promotion make abundantly clear, opportunities are as numerous as the issues, and researchers and graduate students in global public health, health promotion, and chronic disease epidemiology will find these chapters positive and realistic.p>",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gQ4BvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gQ4BvgAACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gQ4BvgAACAAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=466&source=gbs_api

How best for policy to address these increases, however, depends in part on the degree to which they represent increases in the real quantity of medical services as opposed to increased unit prices of existing services. And an even more fundamental question is the degree to which the increased spending actually has purchased improved health. ""Accounting for Health and Health Care"" addresses both these issues. The government agencies responsible for measuring unit prices for medical services have taken steps in recent years that have greatly improved the accuracy of those measures.

As a relatively recent subdiscipline of economics, health economics has been remarkably successful. It has made or stimulated numerous contributions to various areas of the main discipline: the theory of human capital; the economics of insurance; principal-agent theory; asymmetric information; econometrics; the theory of incomplete markets; and the foundations of welfare economics, among others. Perhaps it has had an even greater effect outside the field of economics, introducing terms such as opportunity cost, elasticity, the margin, and the production function into medical parlance. Indeed, health economists are likely to be as heavily cited in the clinical as in the economics literature. Partly because of the large share of public resources that health care commands in almost every developed country, health policy is often a contentious and visible issue; elections have sometimes turned on issues of health policy. Showing the versatility of economic theory, health economics and health economists have usually been part of policy debates, despite the vast differences in medical care institutions across countries. The publication of the first Handbook of Health Economics marks another step in the evolution of health economics.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HPAcajAC2QUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HPAcajAC2QUC&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HPAcajAC2QUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=health&hl=&cd=470&source=gbs_api

Healthcare professionals are increasingly interested in global health and volunteering in areas of acute need. The biggest challenge to health in many locales is the inability to access the health care system. When people do connect with medical services, medications and surgical opportunities for chronic disease (i.e. glaucoma, diabetes, or hypertension) are often not affordable or cannot be sustained for a long period of time. The contributions in this book focus on a respectful dialog with local people and a willingness to learn from new experiences on the part of the volunteer. Skills transfer from visiting personnel to local providers is featured as a means to enhance healthcare sustainability. An appreciation of differing cultures, an understanding of the local economic conditions and challenges, and strategies for collaborating with the existing medical establishment are foundations of successful volunteer experiences as highlighted in this book. Dimensions of global health such as professionalism, religious beliefs, ethical dilemmas, traditional medicine, and alternative strategies for service are addressed by experts.

It demonstrates that spatial disintegration is often intertwined with health and social inequalities, and therefore a multidisciplinary approach to urban health is essential in order to analyze the impact that psycho-social-environmental factors can have on objective, and perceived health and to investigate the inequalities in healthcare and medical assistance processes. Empirical relationships have been observed between urban environment, social vulnerability and health in different contexts, however there is still a lack of standardized tools that allow us to gain a clear understanding of how health inequalities and daily life are generated. In order to address this issue, a national network of active research groups has been created to draft and develop a prototypical analysis infrastructure to facilitate empirical studies aimed at shedding light on the complex relationships between health disparities, socio-environmental and economic distress, as well as personal and collective health. Given the interest in achieving meaningful, fair and lasting solutions to health inequalities, and the current lack of an analytical system, there is the need for new multidisciplinary approaches oriented toward the quality of life within a eco-social model of health. Providing an overview of the methodological approaches discussed, this book will appeal to researchers.

Hurrelmann and Richter build upon the basic theories of health and the popular model of salutogenesis to offer a comprehensive interdisciplinary theory of health genesis and success: Productive Processing of Reality (PPR). The authors show that health is the lifelong dynamic process of dealing with the internal reality of physical and psychological impulses and the external reality of social and material impulses. To demonstrate this, the book is split into three interconnected parts. Part A analyses the determinants of health, providing an overview of the insights of current research and the impact of socioeconomic influences and gender on health. Part B covers public health, social, learning and coping theories, all of which understand health as an interaction between people and their environment. Part C draws on these four theories to outline PPR, stressing the interrelation between physical and mental constitution and the demands of the social and mental environment, and suggesting strategies for coping with these demands during the life course. Understanding Public Health: Productive Processing of Internal and External Reality will be valuable reading for students and researchers in psychology, sociology, educational science, public health and medical science, and for policymakers in public health.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3EDCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3EDCDwAAQBAJ&dq=health&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3EDCDwAAQBAJ&dq=health&hl=&cd=479&source=gbs_api

Far from being a recent phenomenon, however, the practice of self-improvement has a long and rich history, extending all the way back to ancient China. For millennia, philosophers, sages, and theologians have reflected on the good life and devised strategies on how to achieve it. Focusing on ten core ideas of self-improvement that run through the world’s advice literature, Anna Katharina Schaffner reveals the ways they have evolved across cultures and historical eras, and why they continue to resonate with us today. Reminding us that there is much to learn from looking at time-honed models, Schaffner also examines the ways that self-improvement practices provide powerful barometers of the values, anxieties, and aspirations that preoccupy us at particular moments in time and expose basic assumptions about our purpose and nature.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oiQ7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oiQ7EAAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oiQ7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Specially commissioned chapters from leading figures in the discipline give critical examinations of the progress and direction of debates, as well as a foundation for future research. Oxford Handbooks provide scholars and graduate students with compelling new perspectives upon a wide range of subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. A rich source of authoritative content that supports reading and study in the field, The Oxford Handbook of Eating Disorders reviews current research and clinical developments through synthetic chapters written by experts from various fields of study and clinical backgrounds. Epidemiologic studies suggest that eating disorders are not only common but have increased in prevalence in recent decades, and this handbook refines and updates the state of research. The book is divided into four sections: phenomenology and epidemiology of the eating disorders, approaches to understanding the disorders, assessment and comorbidities of the disorders, and prevention and treatment. The first section deals with classification and epidemiology of the disorders, considerations for revisions to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the somewhat neglected topic of eating disorders in childhood and early adolescence. The second section describes research basic to understanding the eating disorders and addresses biological factors, psychosocial risk factors, cultural factors, and the effects of behaviors such as dieting and eating and weight concerns in the genesis of the eating disorders. The third section describes assessment of the eating disorders, medical and psychological comorbidities, and medical management. The final section deals with various treatment modalities that have been found successful, including psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches; an overview of evidence-based treatment for the eating disorders; and a consideration of what we know about cost-effectiveness of existing treatments. The multiple perspectives and breadth of scope offered by The Oxford Handbook of Eating Disorders make it an invaluable resource for clinicians, researchers, and educators, as well as scholars and students.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yyov59F4anoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Yyov59F4anoC&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Yyov59F4anoC&pg=PA396&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api
4hniEAAAQBAJ,Looking through the Speculum,Judith A. Houck,Medical,2024-01-19,University of Chicago Press,,,385,"Highlights local history to tell a national story about the evolution of the women’s health movement, illuminating the struggles and successes of bringing feminist dreams into clinical spaces. The women’s health movement in the United States, beginning in 1969 and taking hold in the 1970s, was a broad-based movement seeking to increase women’s bodily knowledge, reproductive control, and well-being. It was a political movement that insisted that bodily autonomy provided the key to women’s liberation. It was also an institution-building movement that sought to transform women’s relationships with medicine; it was dedicated to increasing women’s access to affordable health care without the barriers of homophobia, racism, and sexism. But the movement did not only focus on women’s bodies. It also encouraged activists to reimagine their relationships with one another, to develop their relationships in the name of personal and political change, and, eventually, to discover and confront the limitations of the bonds of womanhood. This book examines historically the emergence, development, travails, and triumphs of the women’s health movement in the United States. By bringing medical history and the history of women’s bodies into our emerging understandings of second-wave feminism, the author sheds light on the understudied efforts to shape health care and reproductive control beyond the hospital and the doctor’s office—in the home, the women’s center, the church basement, the bookshop, and the clinic. Lesbians, straight women, and women of color all play crucial roles in this history. At its center are the politics, institutions, and relationships created by and within the women’s health movement, depicted primarily from the perspective of the activists who shaped its priorities, fought its battles, and grappled with its shortcomings.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4hniEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4hniEAAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4hniEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api

The first section discusses the different roles and practices of specialised community care that contribute to the relative success of the healthcare system in Hong Kong. The second section makes use of various research practices to extrapolate future healthcare needs and practices in Hong Kong. And the last one addresses the values of health care which underlie the healthcare culture, structure and practice in Hong Kong over time. Apart from pointing out the limitation of the current system, this book will also discusses the future directions of the healthcare system in order to cope with the challenges in a changing society.

KRbNEAAAQBAJ,Mental Health of Refugees,Paul M.G. Emmelkamp,Psychology,2023-07-24,Springer Nature,,,276,"The book provides a comprehensive review of mental health in refugees by discussing its multiple dimensions, and analyzing epidemiology, etiology, and culturally adapted assessment and treatment. Key topics include why certain refugees cope successfully with traumatic experiences while others do not, and the biological, psychological, and social processes underlying posttraumatic stress disorder, common mental disorders, substance abuse and personality disorders. The text examines topics such as complexities of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery for refugees. Furthermore, the roles of culture, social support, and mental health workers in the process of overcoming mental health problems in refugees are discussed. Together, the chapters provide an in-depth examination of the current understood causes, and impacts of mental health problems and treatment of refugees to inform future work in the field. The book gives its readers a solid basis for understanding mental health problems of refugees and sets out to present practitioners with a state-of-the-art summary of all the latest developments and practical guidance. Furthermore, this book provides the practitioner with instructions on how culturally adapted treatments can be used not only with adults, but also with children and young people to help the practitioner to prepare for working with this difficult client group. Drawing from a range of different fields of study, this text will appeal to readers across psychological, mental health, medical, and academic disciplines.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KRbNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KRbNEAAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KRbNEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA169&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api

Gw2BDwAAQBAJ,The Politicization of Safety,Jane K. Stoever,Law,2019-02-26,NYU Press,,,410,"A look at gun control, campus sexual assault, immigration, and more that considers the future of responses to domestic violence Domestic violence is commonly assumed to be a bipartisan, nonpolitical issue, with politicians of all stripes claiming to work to end family violence. Nevertheless, the Violence Against Women Act expired for over 500 days between 2012 and 2013 due to differences between the U.S. Senate and House, demonstrating that legal protections for domestic abuse survivors are both highly political and highly vulnerable. Racial and gender politics, the move toward criminalization, reproductive justice concerns, gun control debates, and political interests are increasingly shaping responses to domestic violence, demonstrating the need for greater consideration of the interplay of politics, domestic violence, and how the law works in people’s lives. The Politicization of Safety provides a critical historical perspective on domestic violence responses in the United States. It grapples with the ways in which child welfare systems and civil and criminal justice responses intersect, and considers the different, overlapping ways in which survivors of domestic abuse are forced to cope with institutionalized discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and immigration status. The book also examines movement politics and the feminist movement with respect to domestic violence policies. The tensions discussed in this book, similar to those involved in the #metoo movement, include questions of accountability, reckoning, redemption, healing, and forgiveness. What is the future of feminism and the movements against gender-based violence and domestic violence? Readers are invited to question assumptions about how society and the legal system respond to intimate partner violence and to challenge the domestic violence field to move beyond old paradigms and contend with larger justice issues.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gw2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Gw2BDwAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Gw2BDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api
HMappSsEgjUC,Working With Troubled Men,Morley D. Glicken,Health & Fitness,2006-04-21,Routledge,,,336,"This book offers a concise, readable, research-grounded synthesis of the special concerns mental health and other helping professionals need to address when working with men today, and explains a wealth of effective gender-specific approaches to assessment and intervention that result in more successful outcomes for male clients. Many more women than men seek counseling and therapy, and to some extent standard services have evolved in response to female styles of communicating and problem-solving. Practitioners frequently feel frustrated and baffled by their male clients because they seem unresponsive to treatment approaches that work so well for women. But many men benefit from therapy when practitioners understand male socialization and the ways men communicate and problem-solve. Too many men today are doing badly and are in real need of help. Almost half of America's male children grow up in single parent homes headed by mothers, where they seldom have male mentors or role models. Fewer men than women attend or graduate from college, and increasing levels of binge drinking and date rape on campuses paint a discouraging picture of men on campus. Male violence continues to be a serious problem in many American communities, with male youth violence continuing at epidemic levels. Men die younger than women overall and in much higher proportions from suicide, homicide, and cirrhosis of the liver.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HMappSsEgjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HMappSsEgjUC&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HMappSsEgjUC&pg=PT123&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api

Nevertheless, in the course of the Accession, one could hardly fix the European standards of social policy or examine to what degree the newcomers may have approached them. Evidently, there has always been a variety of welfare regimes in the EU. Moreover, today's experts in post-communist countries do not find stable policies and institutional arrangements in the West but rather another reform process, the ""domestication"" of the classical welfare states. True, the general trends are not dissimilar: partial retrenchment, decentralization, marketisation and privatisation of public welfare services, as well as an upsurge of the voluntary sector, are the main characteristic features of regulating welfare on both sides of the former Iron Curtain.

Sartorius The size of the world's population aged over 65 was estimated at about 250 million in 1980; by the year 2025 it is expected to grow to about 760 million (see Hauser, this volume). This sharp increase in life expectancy at birth, in some countries amounting to almost 100% in only a hundred years, has resulted from better nutrition and improved living conditions, hygiene and medical care. Not only life expectancy at birth, but also further life expectancy in advanced age has shown a clear, though more moderate increase. This increased life expectancy, together with a simultaneous fall in birth rates, has caused the mean age of the world population and, especially, the average age of the population of industrial nations to climb substantially in recent times, a development which will reach its peak only some decades from now. For these demographic reasons alone, health care authorities will have to devote more attention to the health problems of the elderly. The main task of medical research is to develop improved methods of disease prevention and treatment. Yet, because the full benefits of such research are only realized after many years of work, researchers have already begun to respond to demographic pressures by focussing part of their efforts on the study of illnesses characteristic of old age.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KUYBBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KUYBBQAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KUYBBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA251&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api
cfwnDwAAQBAJ,Recovery the Native Way,Dr. Alf H. Walle,Education,2008-11-01,IAP,,,92,"In recent years, there has been a growing awareness that Native clients who suffer from substance abuse often face challenges that are distinct from those experienced by the mainstream population. For a number of years, I have been involved in research involving Native alcoholism and I have recently published a book on the subject titled The Path of Handsome Lake: A Model of Recovery for Native People. My book argues that many different Native cultures (in America and elsewhere) face similar challenges and disruptions because their cultures are often under great stress and/or because people are alienated from their heritage. The dyfunctional responses of many different Native people are similar because they are subjected to similar pressures. In a nutshell, due to contact with the outside world, Native cultures often experience disruptive transitions, and (in some instances) entire cultures or ways of life may face extinction. Under such circumstances, the culture loses the ability to support people and help them cope with the pressures of life. Cultural decline itself often causes additional trauma. Combined, these pressures can trigger dysfunction within the Native community. The obvious antidote for such maladies is to help Native substance abusers to reconnect with their heritage in positive and constructive ways. My earlier book and this one are inspired by the life and work of nineteenth century Iroquois leader Handsome Lake who developed a method to help Native people embrace their heritage as they recovered from substance abuse. Because my earlier book was scholarly and not focused on practitioner issues, using it within a therapeutic context may be difficult. Here, I adapt my ideas so they can be applied to therapy in a systematic and productive manner. The total program of therapy is presented in three volumes. The first is a short overview of the program that has been written at about a 10th-grade reading level. My goal is to provide a wide range of clients (as well as those who pursue self-help work) with an easily understood description of the program. The second document is a consumable workbook designed to be used with the reader. The workbook can be used both within the context of therapy and by those seeking strategies of self-help. The volume you are reading is a guide for therapists to consult when using this method to help Native clients. It is hoped that all three of these texts will play a significant role in the therapy and recovery of Native substance abusers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfwnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cfwnDwAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cfwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api

Accordingly, the means of treatment must acknowledge and address these differences. Despite this call for specialized care, no theoretically grounded therapy has yet been made available to rural patients. Behavioral Therapy for Rural Substance Abusers, developed and piloted over three years by University of Kentucky faculty and staff and substance abuse counselors in rural eastern Kentucky, provides a model for effective treatment for this segment of the population. A two-phase outpatient treatment, this approach combines group and individual sessions in an environment that is both comfortable and useful for the client. The success of this method lies in its regional approach to therapy. Rather than using role-playing techniques to examine old behaviors, therapy is designed around storytelling activities. Rural patients respond more positively to such time-honored traditions and thus become active participants in their own treatment. This manual offers a clear and well-constructed guide through the strategies of Structured Behavioral Outpatient Rural Therapy (SBORT). Supplemented with illustrations, sample exercises, and case studies, Behavioral Therapy for Rural Substance Abusers is a vital tool in meeting the treatment needs of an otherwise ignored rural population.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IqEfBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IqEfBgAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IqEfBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api

j_jHDwAAQBAJ,Rhetoric of the Protestant Sermon in America,"Eric C. Miller, Jonathan J. Edwards",Language Arts & Disciplines,2020-01-20,Rowman & Littlefield,,,203,"In Rhetoric of the Protestant Sermon in America: Pulpit Discourse at the Turn of the Millennium, ten scholars analyze notable sermons from the fifty-year span between 1965 and 2015, during which the Protestant sermon has undergone significant change in the United States. Contributors examine how this turbulent time period witnessed a variety of important shifts in the arguments, evidences, and rhetorical strategies employed by contemporary preachers. Because religious practice is inextricably tangled in the culture, politics, and economy of its historical situation, the public expression of a faith is certain to move with the times. In their treatment of race, sex, gender, class, and citizenship, sermons apply ancient texts to current events and controversies, often to revealing effect. This collection, thoughtfully edited by Eric C. Miller and Jonathan J. Edwards, demonstrates how the genre of the Protestant sermon has evolved—or resisted evolution—across the years. Scholars of religion, rhetoric, communication, sociology, and cultural studies will find this book particularly useful.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j_jHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j_jHDwAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j_jHDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api

BMb_hakiBNAC,Reading Is My Window,Megan Sweeney,Social Science,2010-02-15,Univ of North Carolina Press,4,1,351,"Drawing on extensive interviews with ninety-four women prisoners, Megan Sweeney examines how incarcerated women use available reading materials to come to terms with their pasts, negotiate their present experiences, and reach toward different futures. Foregrounding the voices of African American women, Sweeney analyzes how prisoners read three popular genres: narratives of victimization, urban crime fiction, and self-help books. She outlines the history of reading and education in U.S. prisons, highlighting how the increasing dehumanization of prisoners has resulted in diminished prison libraries and restricted opportunities for reading. Although penal officials have sometimes endorsed reading as a means to control prisoners, Sweeney illuminates the resourceful ways in which prisoners educate and empower themselves through reading. Given the scarcity of counseling and education in prisons, women use books to make meaning from their experiences, to gain guidance and support, to experiment with new ways of being, and to maintain connections with the world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMb_hakiBNAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BMb_hakiBNAC&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BMb_hakiBNAC&pg=PA181&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api

It encompasses the applicable sources of Jewish law from the original transmission to Moses on Sinai of the terse written law and its accompanying oral elaboration through its development to the present day. Each topic concludes with the authors’ view of the present status of the law. In former years, the public teaching and discussion of law occupied a prominent place in Jewish culture. Today, estrangement from the language of Halacha has made it less accessible to the general public.

EumADwAAQBAJ,"More Than Fluency: the Social, Emotional, and Cognitive Dimensions of Stuttering","Barbara J. Amster, Evelyn R. Klein",Medical,2018-04-27,Plural Publishing,,,265,"More Than Fluency: The Social, Emotional, and Cognitive Dimensions of Stutteringprovides a thoughtful and contemporary framework for speech-language pathologists and others working with people who stutter. The text focuses on the social, emotional, and cognitive realms of stuttering and offers new insights and applications based on research in the field. It guides the reader through theoretical discussions about the social experiences, emotional complications, and cognitive interpretations that often influence the person who stutters. The text also offers practical strategies for intervention from contributing authors who are prominent theorists, researchers, and practitioners in the field of fluency and stuttering. In line with the current multifactorial view of stuttering, More Than Fluency emphasizes the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of stuttering, drawing important connections between them. The authors present a variety of therapeutic interventions and techniques along with practical guidelines that have been designed to alleviate distress in those who stutter. Although these interventions differ in approach, each offers their own roadmap to support and empower people who stutter. The idea for this book grew out of the insights gained from listening to both clients and graduate students. Clients wanted to talk about their life experiences as a person who stutters. Graduate students often described their worry and uncertainty when dealing with the emotional and social issues of their clients who stutter. Similarly, many practicing speech-language pathologists also have concerns about treating people who stutter, especially regarding the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of the disorder, areas not typically taught in traditional coursework. More Than Fluency was developed for practicing speech-language pathologists and other professionals who evaluate and treat people who stutter. It is also intended to be an academic textbook used in graduate courses on fluency and stuttering. This text provides a collection of well-thought-out programs and approaches that help treat the whole person, not just his or her stuttering. The authors believe that this is best practice because successfully treating a person who stutters encompasses treating more than fluency.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EumADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EumADwAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EumADwAAQBAJ&pg=PA190&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api

The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic reversed trends in maternal and neonatal mortality and contraception rates, increasing unmet family planning needs, and gender-based violence. Evidence shows that midwifery care has made an essential contribution to the development of high-quality services in maternal and childcare. The introduction of midwifery professionals, trained according to international standards and integrated into the health system, can provide around 90% of primary health care for women and newborns, including family planning. These skilled professionals can save lives and improve the health and well-being of women and newborn infants at a scale unmatched by other health interventions. Evidence identified 56 outcomes improved by the full scope of midwifery. The weight of sexual and reproductive health on general health and wellbeing has a greater impact on women particularly those that are neglected to receive high-quality SRC. Providing high-quality SRC demands more humanized and integrated, efficient, and effective services with a greater emphasis on quality, both from a technical perspective and from the user experience. Despite all the efforts, the quality of SRC is still a challenge globally, research is needed to identify best practices addressing quality care tailored to individuals, implementation of models of care that enhance both well-being and safety, optimization of physiological processes during childbirth as well as validation of outcomes measures.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SVdHEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SVdHEQAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SVdHEQAAQBAJ&pg=PA20&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api

6B91AwAAQBAJ,Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions,Morley D. Glicken,Psychology,2004-08-28,SAGE Publications,,,353,"The current practice of counseling, psychotherapy, and most helping professions often relies on clinical wisdom with little evidence of what actually works. Clinical wisdom is often a justification for beliefs and values that bond people together as professionals but often fails to serve clients since many of those beliefs and values may be comforting, but they may also be inherently incorrect. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions: An Evidence-Based Approach to Practice covers the use of research and critical thinking to assist helping professionals make the most effective choices in treating clients with social and emotional problems. The use of evidence-based practice (EBP) comes at a time when managed care and concerns over health care costs coincide with growing concerns that psychotherapy, case management, and counseling may not be sufficiently effective ways of helping people in social and emotional difficulty. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions provides an easy-to-read, inclusive approach covering EBP with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and terrorism, bereavement, substance abuse, mental illness, and problems experienced by older adults, among others. This text critically reviews the literature on self-help groups, religious involvement, and spirituality. It also includes sources to find best evidence, a simple overview of research concepts, a chapter on critical thinking, and numerous relevant case studies showing the application of EBP. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions is ideally suited for undergraduate and graduate students in social work, psychology, counseling, criminal justice, psychiatric nursing, and psychiatry. This book should also prove beneficial to all practitioners and specialists in the helping professions.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6B91AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6B91AwAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6B91AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA266&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api

ZLMqBgAAQBAJ,Today’s Priorities in Mental Health,"S.H. Fine, R. Knell, T.Y. Lin",Medical,2012-12-06,Springer Science & Business Media,,,226,"Two themes seem to emerge repeatedly when reading through this volume. One is 'consensus' and the other is 'search'. There was a strong consensus during the Congress that children and families were the major and foremost concern of all present, regardless of their geographic origin or professional background. This concern was often expressed in terms of commitment to or as goal for the international mental health movement for the years to come. The second theme, 'search', represents an effort to translate this concern into activities: search for concrete, immediate goals, for ways and means of translating into actual programs and projects, for interested people to carry on the work and better ways to train them to do the work well, for ways to obtain support, and lastly, search for ways of coordinating efforts of people in different parts of the world. All these and other matters are taken up in the discussions in this volume. The complexity of problems encountered in a rapidly changing world and the diversity of resources available in different parts of the world, make the task of searching difficult and sometimes confusing. In spite of the earnest efforts made, the results may be inconclusive and some of those pro posed can be regarded only as hypotheses or ideas for experimentation.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZLMqBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLMqBgAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLMqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA236&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api

This is what your psychologist would really tell you–if he thought you could handle it! This is the kick up the backside the self-help genre needs: an intelligent, provocative and thought-provoking expose of the modern myths that we’re told make us happier, but in reality screw us up. Clinical psychologist, Dr Stephen Briers shines a light into the dark corners of self-help and explodes the myths, false hopes, quack philosophies and unrealistic expectations it routinely advocates. It is a refreshing antidote to the `same old same old’ approaches, offering a radical re-think of the way we approach problems in our lives, offering empowering new perspectives and expert advice on avoiding the biggest life traps. Dr Briers questions the perceived wisdom, shakes up the status quo, and encourages us to think again.

n2KTzQEACAAJ,Self-Help (llustrated),Samuel Smiles,Uncategorized,2020-05-31,,,,298,"A bestseller immediately after its publication in 1859, Self-Help propelled its author to fame and rapidly became one of Victorian Britain's most important statements on the allied virtues of hard work, thrift, and perseverance. Interpreted by some as a paean to personal avarice, Smiles's most celebrated book is in fact a practical and engaging tribute to the working- and lower-middle classes, in whom he identified the capacity for self-improvement and for whom he tirelessly advocated the right of social advancement. Part practical guide, part proverbial testament, part secular hagiography, this literary hybrid turns biography into an inspirational medium that awakens the reader to their own potential and instills the desire to succeed. Smiles's book is the precursor of today's motivational and self-help literature, although its vision is significantly more cosmopolitan than that of most books in an ever-expanding genre.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n2KTzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=n2KTzQEACAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=n2KTzQEACAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=182&source=gbs_api

_DGGAAAAIAAJ,Residential Environments,"Juan I. Aragones, Guido Francescato, Tommy Gärling",Political Science,2002,Praeger,,,288,"Housing fulfills a basic human need for shelter. It protects us from the weather and from hostile intruders. Often it is an expression of personal identity and social status. A home is a major personal financial investment and housing is an important part of the economy. The home is also invested with profound psychological and social meaning. It helps meet our needs to feel rooted and to belong. It is a center of privacy, a refuge from the world, and at the same time the place where we interact with our family, friends, and acquaintances. As such the home is an important factor in personal and social development, particularly in childhood. Because of the complex role of housing in human life, residential environments are an important area of study in a wide variety of fields, including anthropology, architecture, economics, environmental design, geography, psychology, and sociology. The dwelling is the nucleus around which the discourse about residential environments is articulated, but it is not its only component. Residential environments also involve other elements such as the neighborhood, neighbors, and the larger urban community. This multidisciplinary study of residential environments conveys the complex nature of people's experiences with thier residences, neighborhoods, and communities.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_DGGAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_DGGAAAAIAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_DGGAAAAIAAJ&q=self-help&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=208&source=gbs_api

Much of this urban growth is taking place in the cities of the developing world and much of it in informal settlements. This book presents cutting-edge research from various world regions to demonstrate these trends. The contributions reveal that informal housing is no longer the domain of the urban poor; rather it is a significant zone of transactions for the middle-class and even transnational elites. Indeed, the book presents a rich view of 'urban informality' as a system of regulations and norms that governs the use of space and makes possible new forms of social and political power. The book is organized as a 'transnational' endeavor. It brings together three regional domains of research--the Middle East, Latin America, and South Asia--that are rarely in conversation with one another. It also unsettles the hierarchy of development and underdevelopment by looking at some First World processes of informality through a Third World research lens.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m1ZPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=m1ZPAAAAMAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=m1ZPAAAAMAAJ&q=self-help&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=271&source=gbs_api

From John Arthur Roebuck and the Crimean War, and Samuel Smiles and the Gospel of Work to Thomas Hughes and the Public Schools and Benjanmin Disraeli and the Leap in the Dark, Asa Briggs provides an assessment of Victorian achievements; and in doing so conjures up an enviable picture of the progress and independence of the last century. For expounding this theme, this interaction of event and personality, Mr. Briggs is abundantly and happily endowed. He is always readable, often amusing, never facetious. He is widely read and widely interested. He has a sound historic judgment, and an unfailing sense for what is significant in the historic sequence and what is merely topical. . . . Above all, he is in sympathy with the age of which he is writing.--Times Literary Supplement",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A2AjAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=A2AjAQAAMAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=A2AjAQAAMAAJ&q=self-help&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=287&source=gbs_api

XpjwCQAAQBAJ,Optimizing the Self,Ole Jacob Madsen,Psychology,2015-06-19,Routledge,,,201,"This book provides an analysis of the social representations of leading self-help genres, including neurolinguistic programming, cognitive self-help therapy, mindfulness, self-management, self-esteem, self-leadership and self-control. Exploring the globalised therapeutic culture of today, the book argues that psychology as ‘science’ is often abandoned to aid the individual pursuit for self-realization and self-optimization. Opposing the view that self-help culture is external to psychology, Madsen argues that it is firmly embedded within psychology, playing an important role in people’s lives. Each chapter traces and critically interprets a range of self-help philosophies and techniques, examining the claims of self-help literature to represent the most innovative psychological, medical or neurobiological research. Discussing each genre in turn, chapters examine key research alongside self-help literature to explore the effectiveness and impact of leading self-help genres in various social contexts and environments. The book offers a contemporary critical overview of issues concerning self-help, combining critical psychology with the theory of social representation to provide a broad perspective on self-help as a valid psychology. Optimizing the Self will be of interest to academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of social representation, critical and cultural psychology and theory, clinical psychology, and the sociology of culture and science. The book will also be of use to critical and cultural psychologists and theorists, as well as clinical psychologists.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XpjwCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XpjwCQAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XpjwCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=387&source=gbs_api

This case concerned the procedures followed, and decisions made, by the Executive and Supreme Court of the United States leading up to execution of a Paraguayan national by the Commonwealth of Virginia in May 1998. The Paraguayan argument was that the defendant had been denied his right to consular assistance as guaranteed under the Vienna Convention.

Bob Proctor, best-selling author and star of The Secret. Description: It's vitally important that you read books. As Mark Twain wrote, ""The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them."" And many would agree that ""personal development"" books are the ones to focus on if you're trying to improve yourself, your position in life and your quality of life. But which ones should you read? There are tens of thousands to choose from. Vic Johnson, a veteran personal development author, speaker and trainer, answers that question for us in ""Self Help Books: The 101 Best Personal Development Classics."" From an 1,100 page ""encyclopedia of success"" to a 28-page speech that became a classic more than a hundred years ago, Vic identifies the publication dates of the classics, the major theme(s) of the book and then some solid reasons to add them to your reading list. Along the way he also shares valuable anecdotes on his personal lessons learned from these authors (some of whom have mentored him).

SHGs, known by many names, are voluntary, member-run groups of peers who share a common issue, utilize lived experience, and practice mutual aid. Borkman’s autoethnographic approach highlights her international SHG participation. Despite initial common values and practices in the 1960s and on, Alcoholics Anonymous, the mental health SHGs, and other SHGs evolved in the US as three separate social movements that became institutionalized by 2000; their history, characteristics, achievements and supportive infrastructure are summarized. British contributors Munn-Giddings and Boyce show in European countries how socio-political contexts shape self-help/mutual aid. Research has shifted from SHGs to peer support since 2000.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7o8cEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7o8cEAAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7o8cEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=432&source=gbs_api

hm5HAAAAMAAJ,Cancer and Self-help,"Mark A. Chesler, Barbara K. Chesney",Health & Fitness,1995,Univ of Wisconsin Press,,,420,"Written for and about the special population of parents of children with cancer, this book explores the remarkable effectiveness of self-help groups and profiles their rapid rise as a resource complementing traditional health care. Mark A. Chesler and Barbara K. Chesney draw on their own experience as members of such groups and on a combined thirty years of research on self-help. They provide essential information for families of children with cancer (and other chronic life-threatening illnesses), for health-care professionals working with them, and for scholars of self-help and psychosocial processes in health care--including explanations of how self-help groups function, why they are effective, and how they can be created and maintained. The authors show that, through self-help groups, parents can learn coping skills, find personal affirmation and mutual support, and share the wisdom gained from their experiences. Chesler and Chesney find that group participation improves parents' coping capabilities in the face of terrible odds and fosters an increased sense of empowerment as they care and advocate for their children in an increasingly complex health care system. Cancer and Self-Help distills the experiences of more than fifty self-help groups and their members over twelve years. It also places cancer self-help groups in a larger context, comparing them to other social movement organizations and to other strategies for personal coping or change. The book includes the voices of individual parents and professionals recounting their experiences; detailed examples of group activities, programs, operating procedures, and organizational structures; fundamental, how-to information on forming a self-help group; comments on the roles and dilemmas of health care professionals in these groups and on the medical care system as a whole, and interpretations of these individual and organizational dynamics.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hm5HAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hm5HAAAAMAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hm5HAAAAMAAJ&q=self-help&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=436&source=gbs_api

To keep up, we must keep on moving and adapting – constantly striving for greater happiness and success. Or so we are told. But the demands of life in the fast lane come at a price: stress, fatigue and depression are at an all-time high, while our social interactions have become increasingly self-serving and opportunistic. How can we resist today's obsession with introspection and self-improvement? In this witty and bestselling book, Danish philosopher and psychologist Svend Brinkmann argues that we must not be afraid to reject the self-help mantra and 'stand firm'. The secret to a happier life lies not in finding your inner self but in coming to terms with yourself in order to coexist peacefully with others. By encouraging us to stand firm and get a foothold in life, this vibrant anti-self-help guide offers a compelling alternative to life coaching, positive thinking and the need always to say 'yes!'",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LVPiDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LVPiDAEACAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LVPiDAEACAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=438&source=gbs_api

Then keep reading... This book is the key to accessing and maximizing your innate mind power potential. You will learn how to use this invaluable peak performance concept to accelerate the development of your mental strength, focus, willpower, self-discipline, and self-confidence to achieve your most important goals. If you want to change and improve your life, the first thing you have to do is improve your thoughts. Your thoughts create your reality, so you better have them under control! By controlling your thoughts, ultimately you control your life and your destiny. So, observe your thoughts every now and then. Replace them with positive thoughts such as ""everything is going to be all right"" every single time they come up. To mentally conceive is only potential mind power. To physically execute is applied mind power! Although it is simple in theory, applied mind power is an advanced skill, and its mastery often separates advanced mental toughness students from beginning and intermediate students.

The few faddists who maintain that we should bolt our nourishment, after the manner of the dog and others of the lower animals, can no longer get a hearing; we know that we should chew our food. And if it is natural that we should chew our food, the more thoroughly we chew it the more completely natural the process must be. If you will chew every mouthful to a liquid, you need not be in the least concerned as to what you shall eat, for you can get sufficient nourishment out of any ordinary food.FROM THE BOOK",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=saGmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=saGmEAAAQBAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=saGmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=451&source=gbs_api
xES3oQEACAAJ,Mental Health Self-Help,"Louis D. Brown, Scott Wituk",Psychology,2014-10-19,Springer,,,0,"Building on earlier patient-empowerment movements, consumer- and advocate-driven mental health self-help (MHSH) initiatives currently outnumber traditional mental health organizations. At the same time, this apparent success raises significant questions about their short-term efficacy and their value to lasting recovery. Mental Health Self-Help assembles the state of the evidence on the effectiveness of MHSH, beginning with the individual and larger social factors behind the expansion of consumer-directed services. Clearly organized and accessibly written, the book traces the development and evolution of MHSH as both alternative and adjunct to traditional mental health structures, offers research-based perspectives on the various forms of MHSH, and identifies potential areas for consumer initiatives to work with—and help improve—mental health systems. Contributors weigh strengths and limitations, raise research and methodology questions, and discuss funding and training issues to give readers a deeper understanding of the field and an informed look at its future impact on mental health treatment. Individual chapters cover the spectrum of contemporary self-help initiatives in mental health, including: • Online mutual aid groups. • Consumer-run drop-in centers. • Family and caregiver groups. • Certified peer support specialists. • Consumer advocacy initiatives. • Technical assistance organizations. • Professional/self-help collaborations. Mental Health Self-Help is a bedrock guide to an increasingly influential aspect of the mental health landscape. Researchers studying these initiatives from a variety of fields including community and clinical psychology, and public health—as well as clinicians, counselors, social workers, case managers, and policymakers—will find it an indispensable reference.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xES3oQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xES3oQEACAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xES3oQEACAAJ&dq=self-help&hl=&cd=452&source=gbs_api

Cultural critic Micki McGee puts forward this paradoxical question as she looks at a world where the market for self-improvement products--books, audiotapes, and extreme makeovers--is exploding, and there seems to be no end in sight. Rather than seeing narcissism at the root of the self-help craze, as others have contended, McGee shows a nation relying on self-help culture for advice on how to cope in an increasingly volatile and competitive work world. Self-Help, Inc. reveals how makeover culture traps Americans in endless cycles of self-invention and overwork as they struggle to stay ahead of a rapidly restructuring economic order.

But in reality, if you opened your heart, you would feel safe. This is all you need and nothing else. Open your heart and rejoice. Go out to people. Allow your feelings to pass through you. Whatever it is, it's your feelings. Even negative feelings are more honest. Allow and accept it. Just accept your heart, that's all, there are no other topics. We are human beings with emotional goals. To feel affection, to allow love, and to express our feelings. Like it, we sing about it, we read about it, we write about it. Allow the anger to go away. Allow love to be and accept that you are human. Accept that you are weak. And accept that you are ignorant. You will not develop and change until you allow and accept. Surrender and do not resist. Believe, believe, forgive, allow and be forgiven. The heart only understands the language of feelings. The heart has one question: do you love it or not? Nothing more than this caveman question. Are you an enemy or a lover? Habib, it's over. An enemy to the work of the mind. Let us raise the state of alert to the maximum level. Works and jobs begin, from a doctor, a soldier, and others, and life is created and the matter of love is postponed until further notice. Love is God. Love is life. Love is understanding, science and knowledge. Love is kindness. Love or nothing. The spirit is to continue The goal of any system is to survive and continue. The soul is the way. The soul is the perfection of the path. The soul is perfection. The soul is the path to God. And to God is the end. God is infinite. Have you seen a plant die because its time has come? Have you seen a child who knows or understands the meaning of the word death? We die by self-destructive suicide. Fear is poison. We are poisoned by fear. The world is a house of fear. Heaven is the abode of love. There is no other difference except that we seek to understand this. Science and knowledge are the path to love and life. As long as you are not afraid, you are safe. Survival is the goal of the wise man. And the animal's goal too. The wise man's goal is immortality. Immortality is the goal of the great and the mad. Great people are crazy too. Fear for survival and love for heaven Enough with death preacher. Death comes in the form of a preaching cleric, painful feelings, or a seasoned politician. He preaches to you, but you seek happiness and reject fear. Nobody wants to be afraid. Fear of failure is failure. The fear of death is death. The fear of rejection is rejection. Whoever is afraid creates false religiosity or cunning politics. As for the lover, he seeks God and wants his homeland. And he asks for life. Love acceptance and love attachment Every attachment has rejection behind it, every rejection has fear behind it, and every fear has negative judgment behind it. Attachment is the absorption and loss of love energy. The passionate love that is expressed in songs is its greed and begging. Loving songs is an attachment. The culture of acceptance is different from the culture of attachment. Acceptance is tolerance. Acceptance is faith. And satisfaction. Spiritual love is another thing. A soul mate is different from a flame mate. The supportive role of the lover. It differs from the role of enemy critic. Their appearance is the mirror of your personality. Everyone you deal with is you on the inside. They are what you don't know about yourself. Acceptance is love and attachment is fear. Love satisfaction and gratitude. Attachment is anger and fear. Ideas make you believe in yourself Faith is the reason for existence. Faith is the secret of existence. Faith is in an idea. We defend its ideas as we defend our existence. He who believes in himself can believe in anything. He who does not believe in himself does not believe in anything. He does not believe in anything. Faith is the message and meaning that guarantees your survival. What you believe you find and what you do not believe you do not see. Faith is the source of vision. A believer is a leader who sees before people and more than people. Faith is seeing things that have not yet happened. Faith is insight. Faith is victory. Faith is patience. Believe in them and they will believe in you. Deny them and they will deny you. Faith is the source of security. Faith is in the heart.
